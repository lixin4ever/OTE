Great food but the service was dreadful !##food##service
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre .##portions##food
the two waitress's looked like they had been sucking on lemons .

We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts . . . .##desserts
Desserts are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day .##Desserts
I am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places I have tried with higher ratings .

The whole experience was satisfying .
However , it was worth the visit .
The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .##menu##priced
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .##food##ingredients
This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated .##food##fresh;
Appetizer are excellent here; you can make a great and inexpensive meal out of them .##here;##meal
The spicy mussels are a highlight .##mussels
Also get the Onion Rings best we've ever had .##Onion

The food was almost always EXCELLENT .##food
I was pleasently surprised at the taste .##taste
A nice space , as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers .##space##cuisine##seafood

This particular location certainly uses substandard meats .
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .
The Management was less than accomodating .##Management
The ambience is also more laidback and relaxed .##ambience
the teas are great and all the sweets are homemade .##teas##sweets

Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .##dessert##taste
Food was decent , but not great .##Food
I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked .
From the moment you walk in , you feel like you're in the perfect place .

Yes , they're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .##food
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money .##burgers##salads##mango_margareta
It was delicious and large !
Anywhere else , the prices would be 3x as high !##prices

Our waiter was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff to work with .##waiter##staff

Curioni's Pizza has been around since the 1920's .
They make the best pizza in New Jersey .##pizza
I recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year .

Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .##food
There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs .##waiter
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate .##scallops##asparagus##shell_crab##cheese_plate

Food portion was SMALL and below average .##Food_portion
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST !
since the first time I came here I've been hooked .
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs .##chairs
People in the neighborhood seem to love it , too .
in conclusion , THIS PLACE SUCKS ! ! !
My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the Tostada de Tinga . . .##favs##Tostada
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area , so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out !
Have to tell you: Not at all impressed .
The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laidback , all the while being trendy .##bartenders##managers##decor
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal , try the hot and sour soup .##soup##sandwich_meal##soup
This bar has it all great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent service and delicious food .##drinks##atmosphere##service##food

While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .##kitchen_food
There was a heat problem to boot , so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant we had to request to uncheck our coats !
everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .##service##waitresses##atmosphere
It's traditional , simple italian food .##italian_food

In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJbased pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .##hot_dogs##sandwiches##tator_tots##muffins##NJbased_pork_product##boys
Believe me , they live up to the name .
Well , it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks , and then tells us to chill out .##manager##bartender##drinks
Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .##service##table##atmosphere
When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .##dish##chillis
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average when they actually gave people the meals they ordered .##service##food##meals
It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in .##lunch

I have eaten here several times before attending an afternoon performance .
Everything is very cheap .
Be sure to accompany your food with one of their fresh juice concoctions .##food##juice_concoctions
The food is great and the prices are reasonable .##food##prices

One of my Fav spots in the city .
Over priced , overrated . . . .stay away !
Do not go to this restaurant .
since i was in the neighborhood , we made sure to give this a try .
All I can say is they are fantastic .
Dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters .
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go .##meal
I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if we'd gone at a prime time !
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter .

First walking in the place seemed to have great ambience .##ambience
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch .##brunch
This place doesn't get the publicity that Sylvias Soul Food restaurant does , but it should .##publicity
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed .
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home it reheats really well also .##food
Like I said , Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite , but it's mine .
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us .##help

After reading the great reviews , I invited a diehard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE .
Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary .
Feels like family when we go there .
I found the food to be just as good as its owner , Da Silvano , just much less expensive .##food##owner
They have homemade pastas of all kinds I recommend the gnocchi yum !##pastas##gnocchi_yum
My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt flavor .##vegetable_risotto##flavor
What a pleasant surprise !
The main draw of this place is the price .##price
How can hope to stay in business with service like this ?##service
But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the prices are a bit over the top .##dinner##prices
Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !##sandwiches##soup##pizza##homemade_sorbets
the homemade Guacamole , the unbelievable entree , and thee most amazing deserts .##entree
The sushi is reasonably priced and fresh .##sushi##priced
It's nofuss , fast and delicious .
Save room for deserts they're to die for .##deserts
Best things to order are from the grill Churrasco and Ribs .
The traditional Italian items are great cheap and served in a cozy setting .##Italian_items##served##setting
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .##mocha##hot_white_mocha
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend .##lunch
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it .
Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese .##parmesan_cheese
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food , and there was no one to recommend any wine .##waitress##food##wine
The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .##service##portions
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town , Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination .
i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too .
The ambiance was pretty cool , but not worth the hassle .##ambiance
The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad including asking for salad dressing and was instead given a quesedilla .##salad##salad
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I've ever been to , has a great variety of tasty , mouth watering pizza's .
The service was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .##service##food##cost
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit .##food##staff
I had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes##bar
Chef Vincenzo , always there if you need him , is a real talent and a real Roman .##talent
If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service , definitely visit Curry Leaf .##Indian_food##service
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew salads good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot .##salads##kompot##summer
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied not stuffed and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch .##lunch
I'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away . . .been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my fave hang out in the city .
When she complained , the waitress said , Sorry .##waitress
The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store .##quality##meat
They specialize in smoothies and fresh juices .
It first came well done , and I politely sent it back .
I recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best dish of the evening .##dish
The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else .##manager##menu##waiter
In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste .##taste
during busy hrs , i recommend that you make a reservation .##reservation
Don't waste your time or your money .##money
it's good but , like the movie is never as good as the book , this is same analogy .##movie
it was a very warm experience .
I went to Common Stock for brunch and I was so impressed .
now called nikki sushi , sushi is OK .##sushi##sushi
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .##food##served
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out . . .but it's SO worth it .
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .##erbazzone##cheese_plate##dishes
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe .##food##bar

Cool atmosphere but such a let down .##atmosphere
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I didn't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat .##Sashimi_portion##meat
They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .##pizza##ingredients
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seaASPECT1 joint , food was wellprepared and presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .##dinner##food##service
the icing MADE this cake , it was fluffy , not ultra sweet , creamy and light .##MADE
Finally let into the store 5 at a time , to buy expensive slices from a harried staff .##staff
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty .##wait_staff
The wine list is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .##wine_list##priced
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine .
Everything about this place is adorable even the bathroom !
Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .##food##prices##service
THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS .
IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL .
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza at least I don't think they ever made it before this year . . .but it was worth the wait .##pizza##wait
I asked for a simple medium rare steak .
Generously garnished , organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish , but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts equally scrumptious .##grilled_burgers##dish##Jerusalem##beets,_goat_cheese##walnuts
Probably my worst dining experience in new york , and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about .##dining##waiter
Result red velvet: Great texture , soft and velvety , nice hint of cocoa .
Ask for the round corner table next to the large window .##round_corner_table
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy , but full of flavor .##twist##pizza##flavor
The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies although everyone is polite and no one is pushing is a slight turn off .##AC
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews , but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people .##service
Unfortunately , unless you live in the neighborhood , it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure .##location
Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food .##food
The food mostly deepfriedis simple and satisfying .##food
We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened .
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT .##food

I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it .
Somewhat disappointing wine list only new vintages .##wine_list

If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be ! !##priced_food
new hamburger with special sauce is ok at least better than big mac !##special_sauce
Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in sauce generous portions .##pasta##portions
I can understand the prices if it served better food , like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area .##prices##food
Service was awful mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .##Service##staff
To the owners good job guys , this place is a keeper !##job_guys

This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming .##place
perfect for a quick meal .##meal
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events .
The service was great , and they have a whole great deal for birthdays .##service

I reccomend the fried pork dumplings , the orange chicken/beef , and the fried rice .##fried_pork_dumplings##fried_rice
You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu .##menu
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific !##french_fries##dip
Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait , when they tell you it will be 2030 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?##manager##bartender##drinks
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing .##selection_of_wines##variety
If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there , you'll get a chance to really chill out .
They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare .
Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , middle eastern spreads , cheese baclava . . . soooo much middle eastern spreads , and all of it delicious .##veggies##spreads##cheese##falafel##soup##fish##rice##root_vegetables##rice_medley##spinach_thing##spreads##cheese_baclava##spreads
Disappointingly , their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu .##bar_menu
In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sportsbar butch and ornate kitsch .##ornate
I would definitely go back if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard .##martinis
They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip .
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people .##chairs
The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .##hour##service##atmosphere
After waiting for almost an hour , the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order .##waiter
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere .##atmosphere
A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirtcheap prices .##area_residents##prices
Give it a try , menu is typical French but varied .##menu
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice .
but for the value , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group .##spot
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food .##quality_food
We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .##glass_of_wine##wine
It was good , but none of the flavors WOW .

15% gratuity automatically added to the bill .##bill
The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras , but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal .##halibut_cheek_appetizer##portion##foie_gras##meal

Dug the blue bar area too .##bar_area

Not only do they have the best escargot in town ,they always try to accomodate our toddler .
I've been to Sotto Voce several time , and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time !
Between my guest and I , we sampled at least 80% of the menu , and they were all hits .##menu
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic .##Deco##ambiance

The Yellowfin Tuna and Calf's liver are my favorites !##Yellowfin_Tuna##Calf's_liver
Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth .
But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet .##room
Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love .
They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak I tried them ALL .##sauce_cart
Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy try the duck !##sushi##duck
good variety but nothing surprising .
After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie .
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite .
It's always quiet because it's awful .
No green beans , no egg , no anchovy dressing , no nicoise olives , no red onion .##beans##egg##anchovy##nicoise_olives

The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweetandsour .##canai_appetizer##pancake_served##curry##sauce##mango_chicken##take
It doesn't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it's a whole other atmosphere .##atmosphere
I have to say the place was awesome .
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .##ground_chickpea_soup
We requested they reslice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheeselike cubes .##sushi##cubes
The service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food horrible bartenders , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loudmouthed commuters this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .##service##food##bartenders##clientele##staff##concert
If you're in the neighborhood , definitely stop by for a great meal .##meal
Unfortunately , with our show tickets , we didn't have time to sample any desserts .##desserts

Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size .
I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade .##place##chicken_tacos
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .##soup##french_dish##glass_of_wine
Very nice touch that very much fits the place .
However , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile .##drink
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .
If you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .##meal##location
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eyecandy while I was there .
The comments about fried foods is correct below but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good .##comments##foods##dishes##lamb_entree##salads##shrimp)
It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .
Slow service , but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?##service
The sauce is excellent very fresh with dabs of real mozzarella .##sauce
Don't ever bother the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .##drinks##people
The room is a little plain , but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .##room##place
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .##eating_area##space
Before the place didn't call my attention .
And all the [female] servers are cute too , which is always nice .##[female]_servers
The best dessert , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , isn't particularly Hawaiian , but it's a small world when it comes to sweets .##dessert##chocolate##peanut_butter
for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner .##appetizer
Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the service and food is always on the money .##service##food
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .##dinner##music
But now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated , it looks great .
The room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .##room##space##bar##drink
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .##state
Two complaints their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .##appetizer_selection##mozzarella##menu
I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable .
It is bland and nothing extrodinary .
I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .##waitstaff##bday_cake##service
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .##chicken##platters##fresh_leaf_salad
Every time I visit NYC , I come here .
I've been coming here regularly since it opened , about 2 years ago .
The atmosphere takes you to that place , the place many dream of .##atmosphere
several times and put up with the waiters bad manners , knowing that their job isn't easy .
The service is great maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention , the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good . . .##service##desserts##coffee
We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot that this wasn't a place we'd return to .
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for .##served##bread
While the smoothies are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had !##smoothies##fresh_juices
The food is just OKAY , and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla , which is the only dish that's really good .##food##pialla##dish
The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .##guac
The new menu has a few creative items ,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites but they raised the prices , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No , can't , sorry . . . , boy , they won't bend the rules for anyone .##menu##items##prices##staff##words:
It' only open for lunch but the food is so good !##lunch##food
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .##seafood##food
" The menu includes pub fare , steaks and shepherds pie even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians .##menu##fare##steaks##shepherds
How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices ? !##food##prices
The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow .##food##service
i have eaten here on a different occasion the food is mediocre for the prices .##food##prices
I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu !##menu
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu .##menu
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter .##meal##waiter
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .##brunch_today##cranberry_pancakes##rice_milk
Weekends can get crowded , but still highly recommended .
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early .
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .##bartender
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat .
Its good to go there for drink if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .##drink##service
Anyway , the owner was fake .##owner
Owner is pleasant and entertaining .
I have never in my life sent back food before , but I simply had to , and the waiter argued with me over this .##food##waiter
Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the food .##food
Creamy appetizers , eggplant salad , and Greek yogurt (with cuccumber, dill, and garlic) taste excellent when on warm pitas .##appetizers##eggplant_salad##yogurt_(with_cuccumber,_dill,

I recommend this place to everyone .
Great food .##food
The pastas are incredible , the risottos particularly the sepia are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .##pastas##sepia
Overpriced and not tasty
The food here was mediocre at best .##food
It was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $15 . . . .##fish_and_chips
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink . . . . . this place is not worth it . . .##place
Tasty Dog !##Dog
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .##Cypriot_restaurant
But the best pork souvlaki I ever had is the main thing .##pork_souvlaki
Super YUMMY Pizza !##Pizza
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !##eggplant_pizza##pastas
We had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !##half/half_pizza##pizza
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .##food
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .##setting
I paid just about $60 for a good meal , though :##meal
Reliable , Fresh Sushi##Sushi
The sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious .##sashimi##rolls
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week .##Delivery_can_be_spot
We've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .##Kiku
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi .##place##sushi
Creative , consistent , fresh .
Excellent sashimi , and the millennium roll is beyond delicious .##sashimi##millennium_roll
not only is the food##food
My wife and I went to Water's Edge for a romantic dinner .
The waiter was attentive , the food was delicious and the views of the city were great .##waiter##food
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner##place
Place is open till late , no dress code .##Place
Good food my favorite is the seaASPECT0 spaghetti .##food##seaASPECT0_spaghetti
Excellent food for great prices##food
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .##wait_staff
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food .##space##indo-chinese_food
There are no negatives to speak of .

i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good##chicken_pasta_cant
im not necessarily fanatical about this place , but it was a fun time for low pirces .##place
lobster was good , nothing spectacular .##lobster
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked .##pizza
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive .##staff
I love this place##place
I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good .##pizza
The service was quick and friendly .##service
I thought the restaurant was nice and clean .##restaurant
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly .##veal##mushrooms
The potato balls were not dry at all . . . in fact it was buttery .##potato_balls
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN##PLACE
Very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .##service##food##waitresses
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .
the food is always fresh . . .##food
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service##service
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top ? ?##Chicken_teriyaki
food was luke warm .##food
The waitress was not attentive at all .##waitress
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .##banana_tempura
Not because you are "ASPECT0" . . . – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .##food##Four_Seasons
Red Dragon Roll my favorite thing to eat , of any food group hands down##Red_Dragon_Roll
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .##Red_Dragon_Roll
The Seafood Dynamite is also otherworldly .##Seafood_Dynamite
Favorite Sushi in NYC
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC Nobu , Bond Street , JewelBako , etc and Yamato is my favorite .##'best'_sushi_joints##JewelBako
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .##spot##sushi##service
In the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .##summer_months##back_garden_area
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .##rolls
The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts .##rolls
I CAN EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE . . .##PLACE
Gross food – Wow##Gross_food
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .##food
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor .
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole ?
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .
Oh , and I never write reviewsI just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .##place
Great Indian Food !##Indian_Food

We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece .##Voss_bottles
Food was OK .##Food
A beautifully designed dreamy Egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night .
Watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that's more lemony than smoky .##baba_ganoush
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .##Pacifico##place
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .##drinks
The omlette for brunch is great . . .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen . . .
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .##wings_with_chimmichuri
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .##chicken##salads
Also , I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole .##portobello
Overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .##food
Best Indian Restaurant in the City##Indian_Restaurant
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !##Decor##food
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .##Astoria_souvlaki_spot
Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made inhouse even the gyro meat and sausages , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .##food##sausages##ingredients
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to comeif you don't eat one your trip was wasted .##Cypriot_dishes
Best restaurant in Brooklyn

Great food , amazing service , this place is a class act .##food##service##place
This place is a must visit !##place
Delicious , creative and fun .
It is so romantic .
Its dark , and cozy . . there is always jazz music playing when we go .##jazz_music
The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together .##food
I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional tooauthenticforme dish I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring .
For a Fabulous Wedding !
My daughter's wedding reception at Water's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests .
Everyone raved about the atmosphere elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views and the fabulous food !##atmosphere_elegant_rooms##views##food
Service was wonderful;##Service
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .
Paul , the maitre d' , was totally professional and always on top of things .##maitre_d'
Service ok but unfriendly ,filthy bathroom .##Service
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food .##view##food
The bar drinks were Eh , ok to say the least .##bar_drinks
The stuff tilapia was horrid . . .tasted like cardboard .##stuff_tilapia
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .##mens_bathroom
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
Good Experience
During our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pretheater menu offering a modified menu for $65 pp .
The wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .##wine_list##staff##wine_pairings
The bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing .##bread
However , our main course was wonderful .
I had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations .##fish
The dessert we had a pear torte was good but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .##dessert##staff##drink_suggestions
When we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .##ports##waitress
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
All in all , I would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .##staff##details
short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic ,cozy and private .##–_seating
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people .##boths
The service was extremely fast and attentivethanks to the service button on your table but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order .##service##service##waiter
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .##food
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .##actual_meals
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food .##food
Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .
Subtle food and service##food##service
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .##pudding##service##food
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order . . . hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .##food
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .##servers
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .##service##place

BEST DINING EXPERIENCE IN THE WEST VILLAGE !
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York !
Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had !##decor##food
The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for !
I never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending !##restaurant
Maggot in the food !##food
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .##menu##waiter##food
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .##manager##wine
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .##food
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession .##manager##wine##food
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .##customer_service
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .##setting
Great place , great value .##place

Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi , or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much .##place

One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !##One_special_roll##regular_roll##dessert
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .##banana_chocolate_dessert##green_tea_tempura

I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .##spot
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .##atmosphere
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
Another review here claimed the prefix was $29/per person including sake but it is $55 per person not including sake .##prefix
Indo Chinese food , pretty good . . .##Indo_Chinese_food
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes I have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .##chicken_lollipop##Chilli_Chicken
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she being Indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .##place##food
I was speechless by the horrible food .##food
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .##food
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .##vegetarian_dish
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation .##vegetarian_dish##chef##vegetables_minus_sauce
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
This place survives on reputation alone .##place
Best In ALL of NYC

the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside .##hot_dogs##crunch
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost !
Great , original taste .
For me dishes a little oily , but overall dining experience good .

The only thing that strikes you is the decor ?not very pleasant .##decor_?not

One of the best , if not THE best , restaurants in Park Slope and NY in general
Everything on the menu is great .##menu
This establishment is the real deal .
Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate , superb food , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .##food
There is "Expensivebutworthit" and there is "ExpensiveandWTF" ?
This is a twentysomething guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .##meal
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine ?
Look , the appetizers were really good .##appetizers
The entree was also very good .##entree
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .##place
Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi .##Kobe_Beef_Sashimi
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef .##Wagyu_beef
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .
A beef Consomme .##beef_Consomme
Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak .##Vanison_steak
Vanison was good but not amazing .
Dessert pure disaster .##Dessert_pure_disaster
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant" .##Four_Seasons
All in all , the food was great except for the dessserts .##food##dessserts
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
Yes , it is good , but I've had better for cheaper .
Service was just ok , it is not what you'd expect for $500 .##Service
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience !##Casa_La_Femme
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
The place is beautiful !##place
The hostess was very pleasant .##hostess
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !##alla_carte_menu
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner .
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !##drinks
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !##glasses
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .##main_reason##belly_dancers##back
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !##show##food##belly_dancers
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .
The hostess said "Wow that's a large group , unless you aren't together" , to which I replied "no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please ."##hostess
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .##menu
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each .##appetizers##portion
The lobster knuckles special of the day were ok , but pretty tasteless .##lobster_knuckles
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass . . .which was very good .##Fried_Sea_Bass
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !##food##grilled_Mahi_Mahi
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .##lobster_roll
All in all the food was good a little on the expensive side , but fresh .##food
Service not the friendliest to our "large party" !##Service
Great Indian food##Indian_food
Food was amazing I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I've had .##Food
Very "normal Indian food , but done really well .##Indian_food
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is $25 , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel .##place##feel
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price .
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food##place##food
One of the BEST
Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . . "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .##lunch_buffet
We go often for lunch and the place is packed .##place
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .##service
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC##Bukhara
Wretched and retching
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .##service
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .##fish_skin
Not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .##food
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean !##fish
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .##fish
It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it's simply repulsive .##restaurant
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner##place
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !##service##waiter##menu##recommendations
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling .##stone_bowl
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl .
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted .
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .##sauce##Korean
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .##side_dishes
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .##place##service
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited .##squid_dish##waitress
There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English .
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .##food
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .##Korean_food
The wife had the risotto which was amazing .
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black , but the taste was phenomenal .
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .##farro_salad##mashed_yukon_potatoes
i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza##margherita_pizza_–##pizza
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the place we always go .##place##place
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .##crust##sauce##cheese
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .##margherita_pizza
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City##Restaurant
This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie that don’t serve sushi , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !##sushi
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city .##spot
If you’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! .##booths##glass_ceilings
It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !##waiter
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !##BBE_$29_fixe_prix_menu
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .##Green_Yuzu_Sauce
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .##Grilled_Black_Cod##Grilled_Salmon_dish
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .##entrees##miso_soup
The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .##sake’s##sake
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .##desserts##matcha_(powdered_green_tea)##blueberry_cheesecake
Maybe it was the great company I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .##service
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !##service##pita_bread
Great Shabu Shabu##Shabu_Shabu
But for the Shabu Shabu , you won't find much better in NY .##Shabu_Shabu
In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares shabu Tatsu and even then I prefer Dokebi .##shabu_Tatsu
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .##sauces##kimchi_and_a_salad_free##service
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .##Korean_food##pork_belly_tacos
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .##hot_dogs##pork_croquette_sandwich
The food tasted very good .##food
The family seafood entree was very good .##family_seafood_entree
The main entree was also very good .##main_entree
We order a bit of everything on the menu .##menu
Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .##food
This place doesn't make any sense##place
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .##place##food
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work .
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .##food
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .##Spanish_tapas_place
Good Food##Food
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I don't like being cramp in a corner .##food##sitting_space
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
The atmosphere was great .##atmosphere
The food we ordered was excellent , although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .##food##margaritas
Our waitress wasn't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .##waitress
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .
Regardless , we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .##patio
Dumbfoundingly Poor##Dumbfoundingly_Poor
This was , from start to finish , a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience .
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .##servers
Polite acknowledgement is out;
supercilious scorn is in .
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious .
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest .##salmon
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins##place##food##carte_des_vins
At $120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture .
How is this palce still open ?
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .
Everything was going good until we got our meals .##meals
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .##chicken
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .##mashed_potatoes
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he deskinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .##salmon
I took one bite from the $24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .##$24_salmon
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .##waitress##waitress
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .##mashed_potatoes##chicken
I've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! !##better_chicken
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it , and I cannot comp it .
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .##food
The level of rudeness was preposterous .
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .##drinks
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .##EVER_HAD_SUCH
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
cirspy crust margherita pizza##crust_margherita_pizza
it was really good pizza .##pizza
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:::##crust##pizza
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .##decor##pita
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .##Casa_La_Femme##Chuckie_Cheeze
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return it's manhattan , things are expensive .
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that .##scene
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !##decor
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy , or any other for that matter , is beyond me .
Great Hot Dogs !
The hot dogs are top notch , and they're Slamwich is amazing !##hot_dogs
Only complaint is the pricingI believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .##menu
But nonethelessgreat spot , great food .##spot##food
Fabulous food if the front of house staff don't put you off –##food
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
Each time we've been , the front of house staff not the waiters they're fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .##waiters##fish_dishes
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !##staff
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night WTF ? ?
There's another girl who I can't describe , she is about 5'6" with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about .
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .##food##service##maitre-D
While finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine , our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .##meals##dessert
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D sense of " table turnover" , as whacked as it is , or else .##table_turnover"
Best meal in a long time !##meal
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .##Lamb_special
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .##steak##swordfish
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .##Four_Seasons_restaurant
The food is great and the environment is even better .##food
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .##entree
Great Atmosphere##Atmosphere
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .##place##place
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .##fish_tacos
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .##atmosphere##back
Poor service and management##Poor_service##management
Don’t go to this place !##place
When the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .##manager
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .
The food is very good , but not outstanding .##food
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .##staff
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . .but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .##Al_Di_La_staff
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .##salad
The pasta was well cooked , didn't have enough sauce though or flavor .##pasta
Her review is above .
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
My friend is 100% right in the experience we had .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .##hostess
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .##same_waitress
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , "can I help you" and "how many are in your party ."##waitress
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem .
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service .##staff##customer_service
bad staff##staff
I generally like this place .##place
The food is good .##food
The design of the space is good .##design##space
But the service is HORRID !##service
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .##waitress
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .##waiter##food
I can't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !##food
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it .##waitress
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .##staff

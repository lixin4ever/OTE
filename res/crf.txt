Great food .##food
The pastas are incredible , the risottos particularly the sepia are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .##pastas##sepia
The food here was mediocre at best .##food
It was totally overpriced fish and chips was about $15 . . . .##fish_and_chips
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink . . . . . this place is not worth it . . .##place
Tasty Dog !##Dog
An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .
One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten .
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it .##Cypriot_restaurant

Super YUMMY Pizza !##Pizza
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .
I LOOOVE their eggplant pizza , as well as their pastas !##eggplant_pizza##pastas
We had half/half pizza , mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza !##half/half_pizza##pizza
Excellent food , although the interior could use some help .##food
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting , without it trying to be that .##setting
I paid just about $60 for a good meal , though :##meal
Great sake !##sake
Reliable , Fresh Sushi##Sushi

WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN##PLACE
Very immature bartender , didnt know how to make specific drinks , service was so slowwwww , the food was not fresh or warm , waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers .##service##food##waitresses
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .

overpriced japanese food with mediocre service##service
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top ? ?##Chicken_teriyaki
food was luke warm .##food
The waitress was not attentive at all .##waitress
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have .##banana_tempura
Not because you are "ASPECT0" . . . – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .##food##Four_Seasons
Red Dragon Roll my favorite thing to eat , of any food group hands down##Red_Dragon_Roll
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll .##Red_Dragon_Roll

Favorite Sushi in NYC
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming .##spot##sushi##service
In the summer months , the back garden area is really nice .##summer_months##back_garden_area
The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food .##rolls

Gross food – Wow##Gross_food

Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out .##Pacifico##place
The drinks are great , especially when made by Raymond .##drinks
The omlette for brunch is great . . .
the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen . . .
quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri .##wings_with_chimmichuri
A weakness is the chicken in the salads .##chicken##salads

Best Indian Restaurant in the City##Indian_Restaurant
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !##Decor##food
This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .##Astoria_souvlaki_spot
Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made inhouse even the gyro meat and sausages , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .##food##sausages##ingredients
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to comeif you don't eat one your trip was wasted .##Cypriot_dishes

The stuff tilapia was horrid . . .tasted like cardboard .##stuff_tilapia
We thought the dessert would be better , Wrong !##dessert
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .##mens_bathroom
The floor was wet , the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor , no soap , and no hand towels left .
During our trip to NYC , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pretheater menu offering a modified menu for $65 pp .
The wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings .##wine_list##staff##wine_pairings
The bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing .##bread
I had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations .##fish
The dessert we had a pear torte was good but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions .##dessert##staff##drink_suggestions
When we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .##ports##waitress
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location .
All in all , I would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .##staff##details
short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic ,cozy and private .##–_seating

The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy .##food
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals .##actual_meals

Will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .
Impressed . . .
Subtle food and service##food##service
Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy .##pudding##service##food
Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner .
This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order . . . hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant .
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev .##food
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .##servers

We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd .##belly_dancing_show
Maggot in the food !##food
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .##menu##waiter##food
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for .##manager##two_desserts
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .##manager##wine
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .##food
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession .##manager##wine##food
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .##customer_service
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .##setting

I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .##spot
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .##atmosphere
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .
Indo Chinese food , pretty good . . .##Indo_Chinese_food
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food .
The chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes I have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the Chilli Chicken .##chicken_lollipop##Chilli_Chicken
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she being Indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .##place##food
I was speechless by the horrible food .##food
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .##food
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .##vegetarian_dish
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation .##vegetarian_dish##chef##vegetables_minus_sauce
I was so stunned , and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing .
This place survives on reputation alone .##place

This is a twentysomething guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .##meal
Look , the appetizers were really good .##appetizers
The entree was also very good .##entree
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .##place
Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each .
Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi .##Kobe_Beef_Sashimi
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe .
A beef Consomme .##beef_Consomme
Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak .##Vanison_steak
Bison was quite excellent however .
Dessert pure disaster .##Dessert_pure_disaster
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .
All in all , the food was great except for the dessserts .##food##dessserts
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .##food
You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .##service
Service was just ok , it is not what you'd expect for $500 .##Service
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .
The place is beautiful !##place
The hostess was very pleasant .##hostess
However , our $14 drinks were were horrible !
Our experience did not ever get any better .
We asked for beverages and never received them .
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka . . some of which we never received !##drinks
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !##glasses
To top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .##main_reason##belly_dancers##back
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !##show##food##belly_dancers
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .##menu
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each .##appetizers##portion
The lobster knuckles special of the day were ok , but pretty tasteless .##lobster_knuckles
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer .
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .##waitress
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass . . .which was very good .##Fried_Sea_Bass
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !##food##grilled_Mahi_Mahi
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .##lobster_roll
All in all the food was good a little on the expensive side , but fresh .##food
Service not the friendliest to our "large party" !##Service
Great Indian food##Indian_food
Food was amazing I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I've had .##Food
Very "normal Indian food , but done really well .##Indian_food
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is $25 , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel .##place##feel
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .##waiters
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food##place##food
Bukhara Grill , the tagline says it all . . "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it .##lunch_buffet
We go often for lunch and the place is packed .##place
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given .##service
Wretched and retching
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life .
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service .##service
Fine , I wont hang you for that .
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .##fish_skin
Not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .##food
None was made so i hung up .
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean !##fish
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish .##fish
It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it's simply repulsive .##restaurant
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner##place
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot .##fix_menu
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing !##service##waiter##menu##recommendations
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date .
The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling .##stone_bowl
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl .
The nakgi-bokum was horrible .
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted .
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean .##sauce##Korean
The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request .##side_dishes
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service .##place##service
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited .##squid_dish##waitress
As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .##food
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .
We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .
The wife had the risotto which was amazing .
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .##farro_salad##mashed_yukon_potatoes
Love this place , every time we are in the city this is one of the place we always go .##place##place
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza .
The crust has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .##crust##sauce##cheese
Personally I like the margherita pizza better , but they are all good .##margherita_pizza
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city .##spot
If you’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! .##booths##glass_ceilings
It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !##waiter
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !##BBE_$29_fixe_prix_menu
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .##sashimi_amuse_bouche
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .##Green_Yuzu_Sauce
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .##Grilled_Black_Cod##Grilled_Salmon_dish
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .##entrees##miso_soup
The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .##sake’s##sake
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .##desserts##matcha_(powdered_green_tea)##blueberry_cheesecake
Maybe it was the great company I had friends visiting from Philly – yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie .
I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .##service
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !##service##pita_bread
Great Shabu Shabu##Shabu_Shabu
But for the Shabu Shabu , you won't find much better in NY .##Shabu_Shabu

Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .##Korean_food##pork_belly_tacos

The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I don't like being cramp in a corner .##food##sitting_space
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation if possible
The atmosphere was great .##atmosphere
The food we ordered was excellent , although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .##food##margaritas
Our waitress wasn't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .##waitress
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .
Regardless , we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .##patio
Dumbfoundingly Poor##Dumbfoundingly_Poor
This was , from start to finish , a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience .
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .##servers
Polite acknowledgement is out;
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious .
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest .##salmon
The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins##place##food##carte_des_vins
How is this palce still open ?
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .##chicken##salmon
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .##chicken
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .##mashed_potatoes
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he deskinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .##salmon
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .##waitress##waitress
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .##mashed_potatoes##chicken
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .##waitress
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !##desert_menu
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it , and I cannot comp it .
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .##food
The level of rudeness was preposterous .
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .##drinks
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .##EVER_HAD_SUCH
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED .
cirspy crust margherita pizza##crust_margherita_pizza
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes .##margherita_pizza_adn
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:::##crust##pizza
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor , good pita and hummus , and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty .##decor##pita
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place .##place
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .##Casa_La_Femme##Chuckie_Cheeze
This place . . .god where do i begin .##place
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !##decor
Great Hot Dogs !
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here , Bark always delivers on their food .##food
The hot dogs are top notch , and they're Slamwich is amazing !##hot_dogs
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy !
Only complaint is the pricingI believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .##menu
But nonethelessgreat spot , great food .##spot##food
Fabulous food if the front of house staff don't put you off –##food
Each time we've been , the front of house staff not the waiters they're fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .##waiters##fish_dishes
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !##staff
The frizzy retro girl with winged/ Dame Edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink .##winged/_Dame_Edna_glasses
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !##staff
I'm a friendly person , so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head , I expect better service .##service
The food and service were fine , however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .##food##service##maitre-D
While finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine , our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .##meals##dessert
This guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including Paris , that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
His response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D sense of " table turnover" , as whacked as it is , or else .##table_turnover"
Best meal in a long time !##meal
I had the Lamb special which was perfect .##Lamb_special
My father had the flank steak which was very good , and my mother had the swordfish .##steak##swordfish
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience .##Four_Seasons_restaurant
The food is great and the environment is even better .##food
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog .
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .##entree
Great Atmosphere##Atmosphere
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal .##place##place
I highly recommend the fish tacos , everything else was ok .##fish_tacos
Cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .##atmosphere##back
Poor service and management##Poor_service##management
Don’t go to this place !##place
When the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing .
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .##manager
When we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .
The food is very good , but not outstanding .##food
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .##staff
Mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine . . .but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff .##Al_Di_La_staff
The bread was stale , the salad was overpriced and empty .##salad
The pasta was well cooked , didn't have enough sauce though or flavor .##pasta
Her review is above .
My friend is 100% right in the experience we had .
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .##hostess
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane .##same_waitress
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service .##staff##customer_service
bad staff##staff
I generally like this place .##place
The food is good .##food
The design of the space is good .##design##space
But the service is HORRID !##service
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .##waitress
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .##waiter##food
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it .##waitress
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .##staff

Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .##Boot_time
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $ 150 plus .##tech_support
but in resume this computer rocks !
Set up was easy .##Set_up
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions .##Windows_8##touchscreen_functions
I expected so as it 's an Apple product , but I was glad to see my expectations exceeded , this is THE laptop to buy right now .
Other than not being a fan of click pads industry standard these days and the lousy internal speakers , it 's hard for me to find things about this notebook I do n't like , especially considering the $ 350 price tag .##internal_speakers##price_tag
excellent in every way .
No installation disk (DVD) is included .##installation_disk_(DVD)
It 's fast , light , and simple to use .##use
Works well , and I am extremely happy to be back to an apple OS .##Works##apple_OS
This mac has been a problem since we got it .
Sure it 's not light and slim but the features make up for it 100 % .##features
I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long battery life > 6 hrs .##WiFi_connection##battery_life
The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key .##delete_key
Made interneting part of my business very difficult to maintain .
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is priced just right .##priced
Small and still VERY powerful .
I had gotten this model for $ 119900 on my State 's tax-free weekend and had a $ 100 off coupon for a MacBook at the local BestBuy ! .
Super light , super sexy and everything just works .
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me , I only had a problem once or twice with it , But probably my computer was a bit defective .##track_pad
And if you are switching from a pc I hilghy sugest this one .
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics .##graphics
But the mountain lion is just too slow .##mountain_lion
Strong build though which really adds to its durability .##durability
The battery life is excellent 6-7 hours without charging .##battery_life##charging
I enjoy having apple products .
I 've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly .
I will never go back to a PC again !
And I may be the only one but I am really liking Windows 8 .##Windows_8
The baterry is very longer .##baterry
And it 's so quiet that I do n't hear it at all .
Its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .##size##weight
I know Apples are more expensive than PCs , but he thinks it is worth every penny .
To me it 's a workhorse and quiet as can be you even save big bucks not dishing out any extra to Uncle Sam Definite Buy .
I can say that I am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .##performance
I 'm pretty sure when I bought it , my bank account went ouch !
Thank you so much for the great item .
This laptop has only 2 USB ports , and they are both on the same side .##USB_ports
It 's annoying very much and I wo n't ever buy any Acer products .
This is why I purchased a BRAND NEW LAPTOP in the first place so it would n't have ANY problems .
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .##speed##screen
As for the laptop , this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years .
Everything I wanted and everything I needed and the price was great !##price
It 's not inexpensive but the Hardware performance is impressive for a computer this small .##Hardware_performance
It is better than my old acer laptop .
This thing is awesome , everything always works , everything is always easy to set up , everything is compatible , its literally everything I could ask for .##set_up
I would buy it again in a heartbeat !
Keyboard responds well to presses .##Keyboard
If someone called me an Apple Fanboyit would make sense .
Lastly , Windows 8 is annoying .##Windows_8
A scratch on a $ 1,500 MacBook is unforgivable .
I just fell in love with this thing .
Everything is so easy and intuitive to setup or configure .##setup
I have no problems yet on my mac so far , and hope it stays like that .
This laptop is a great buy .
Biggest complaint is Windows 8 .##Windows_8
Only 2 usb ports kind oflimited .##usb_ports
It has been to early to see if this actually fixes the problem or not though .
This device has met my expectations and I 'm sure it will meet yours .
It has all the expected features and more +plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .##features##screen##keyboard
Out of all the laptops I have owned , this is by far the best !
Amazing Performance for anything I throw at it .##Performance
I can never go back to a PC now , this machine never freezes or has any problems .
Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for .
The receiver was full of superlatives for the quality and performance .##quality##performance
I was extremely happy with the OS itself .##OS
I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it .
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .##portability
Great purchase and I definitely did n't miss out on the Black Friday deals .
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing .
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8##Windows_8
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful , well worth it .##MS_Office
After using it for over a month , an issue started to surface .##surface
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .##performance
There has been no problem with anything .
I believe with Apple , you get what you pay for .
They do n't just look good ; they deliver excellent performance .##performance
I have had it over a year now with out a Glitch of any kindI love the lit up keys and screen display thing is Fast and clear as can be .##up_keys##screen_display
The product is prefect for everyone .
The Mountain Lion OS is not hard to figure out if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows .##Mountain_Lion_OS##Microsoft_Windows
However , I can refute that OSX is FAST .##OSX
I waited to review to make sure it is what it is .
Enjoy using Microsoft Office !##Microsoft_Office
I would suggest this product to anyone .
With no problems , I 'm happy with this purchase because I saved money compared to buying it anywhere else .
Incredible graphics and brilliant colors .##graphics
I needed something affordable from Apple and was tired of dealing with PC laptop after PC laptop .
Just bit the bullet and bought the Mac hoping it will last a lot longer .
Built-in apps are purely amazing .##Built-in_apps
Cons , Screen resolution .##Screen_resolution
From the speed to the multi touch gestures this operating system beats Windows easily .##speed##operating_system##Windows
I really like the size and I 'm a fan of the ACERS .##size
This is by far thee best , most reliable computer I could find .
I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty $ 1500-2000 which also support accidents like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare .##Warranty##AppleCare
It 's light and easy to transport .##transport
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated .##Windows_8_Set-Up
Very powerful especially for the money .
When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .
It 's been time for a new laptop , and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops , and whether to spring for the retina display .##size##retina_display
This was a significan'tly more affordable than getting a new MacBook Pro from Apple .
I have always wanted a MacBook Proalways ! .
The reason why I choose apple MacBook because of their design and the aluminum casing .##design##aluminum_casing
The aluminum body sure makes it stand out .##aluminum_body
Overall it 's an amazing product , 5 stars !
It is very easy to integrate bluetooth devices , and USB devices are recognized almost instantly .##integrate_bluetooth_devices##USB_devices
He 's thrilled with his new laptop .
Amazing product as you would expect from Apple .
Nothing wrong with this computer at all !
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me .##Intel4000_graphic_chip
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port will work with adapter and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .##DVD_drive_Firewire_port
No hassle and no complaints .
LOVE IT I 've always been an apple fan boy , but never had the money to buy a mac , only ipads and iphones , and this is my first mac , blew me away completely .
The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money .##durability
Well designed and fast .
And now I am a proud MacBook owner also !
But I was completely wrong , this computer is UNBELIEVABLE amazing and easy to use .##use
Exactly as posted plus a great value .##value
The specs are pretty good too .##specs
I am having a friend look at it , but will probably return it .##look
There were no scratches or dents or any marks at all .
I 've only had it one day , but I really do love it and I 'm happy it was economical and I 'm finally able to own a Mac !
Since I have always used Apple products , the choice of Macbook Pro was obvious .
Apple is unmatched in product quality , aesthetics , craftmanship , and customer service .##quality##customer_service
This is my first apple laptop .
It makes a great gift .
It is a great size and amazing windows 8 included !##size##windows
I would recommend to any one lloking for a first class computer !
I do not like too much Windows 8 .##Windows_8
Startup times are incredibly long , over two minutes .
I bought this Macbook Pro from Best Buy under a year ago to replace my old Macbook Air .
The macbook pro is really responsive .
Also stunning colors and speedy##colors
it is really expensive though .
great price free shipping what else can i ask for ! !##price##shipping
This mouse is terrific .##mouse
I will also say it is much better than I expected !
This computer does everything i need it to do for school and more .
It is really thick around the battery .##battery
And windows 7 works like a charm .##windows_7_works
And I can attach my projector to it .
, Great product , great price , great delivery , and great service .##price##delivery##service
, ] It arrived so fast and customer service was great .##customer_service
tried windows 8 and hated it ! ! !##windows
The price is higher than most lab top out there ; however , he/she will get what they paid for , which is a great computer .##price
So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .
Set up was a breeze .##Set_up
But I do NOT like Win8 .
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers , but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .
I am still in the process of learning about its features .##features
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that died and found that I was not alone , far from it .
I had the same reasons as most PC users , the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .##price##OSX##support##games
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .##mobility
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .
Very nice so far .
You wo n't be disappointed .
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .##price
I found the mini to be , Exceptionally easy to set up##set_up
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .
The sound is nice and loud ; I do n't have any problems with hearing anything .##sound
It is very slim , the track pad is very much impressed with me .##track_pad
This was the same problem with my MacBook circa 2007 that I just retired .
Great things come in small packages .
HUGE Apple MAC Fan !##Fan
Looked at HP , ASUS , Acer , Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked .
The settings are not user-friendly either .##settings
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .
The machine is used , but is like new , i 'm very impress .
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !##OpenOffice
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .##battery_life
Needless to say , the leap from that to this has been amazing and aside from the financial reasons I am astounded that I had n't made the switch sooner .
Its perfect , not much heavy .
i love the keyboard and the screen .##keyboard##screen
I find it not to be very user friendly .
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .##touchpad
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !
I 've already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .
So this is very good commputer and i highly suggest it .
the mbp i recieved was everything it should have been .
I was going to buy today and noticed it went back up to $ 34499 ? .
Not as fast as I would have expect for an i5 .
SO of course this one came through with the awesomeness !
You will not regret buying this computer !
Nothing bad to say about it .
It s heavy for Mac book but is good .
thanks for great service and shipping !##service##shipping
Deal of the year .
My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason .
Minis make sense for a lot of people .
The performance seems quite good , and built-in applications like iPhoto work great with my phone and camera .##performance##built-in_applications##iPhoto_work##camera
This Mac Mini makes the Macbook Pro seem slow .
I did swap out the hard drive for a Samsung 830 SSD which I highly recommend .##hard_drive
I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC a Sony Vaio , but it was basically no better than my old PC , so I returned it .
I wanted a simple , reliable laptop .
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !
I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer .
Extremely disappointed with the way it is .
Never been happier using computer .
I have had a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures .
Does everything I wanted this laptop to do .
Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .
Turns out this is a common problem .
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .
It is also fast as can be you get what you pay for well worth the investment .
But I 'm still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .
Overall very impressed , Thank you Apple and Amazon !
Yes , that 's a good thing , but it 's made from aluminum that scratches easily .
Very fast for my needs .
I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop .
Quick and has built in virus control .##virus_control
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without .##retina_display
I saw the Mini Mac at Best Buy and decided to get this as my replacement .
I finally decided on this one and could n't be any happier .
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .##components
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product .
Have n't regretted it one bit .
The one thing that Apple does right is computers .
the hardware problems have been so bad , i ca n't wait till it completely dies in 3 years , TOPS !##hardware
It 's so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine has the snow lion !##battery##snow_lion
I think that they are the best out on the market .
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .##shipping
That 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .
My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere .
it 's exactly what i wanted , and it has all the new features and whatnot .##features
You can do absolutely anything and is very fast and stylish .
Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC 's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said buy a MAC .
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?##quality
It feels cheap , the keyboard is not very sensitive .##keyboard
That defeated the whole point of a laptop .
Though please note that sometimes it crashes , and the sound quality isnt superb .##sound_quality
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .##navigate
But until now , no complains at all .
The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with .##cons
Does everything I need it to , has a wonderful battery life and I could n't be happier .##battery_life
Great Performance and Quality .##Performance##Quality
Just What I Needed For Portable And My Wallet Too !
The device speaks about it self .
I used windows XP , windows Vista , and Windows 7 extensively .##windows_XP##windows_Vista##Windows_7
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase is they released a newer updated mbp seriously RIGHT after i bought this one .
it does get hot when using on a bed or sofa and gets warm on a deskthis is in an un-air conditioned roomin air condition it gets slightly warm .
I did add a SSD drive and memory##SSD_drive##memory
I got this one for thanks giving Offer for $ 962 , .
I had my PC laptop for 3 years and going to a MacBook Pro is like I leaped through time .
On start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products .
Pretty much made sense to get a Mini .
I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS .##OS
not something you want to miss out on ! ! !
One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .##charging_cables##iPhone/iPod_touch_cables
I bought it to my son who uses it for graphic design .
I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years .
Its a pretty decent computer .
I never tried any external mics with that iMac .
The new os is great on my macbook pro !
It was fast , and it was different .
I had a little problem adjusting to the small screen but works fine as long as I remember to carry my glasses .##screen##works
I purchased my first Mac and am glad I did .
I have experienced no problems , works as anticipated .
System is running great .##System
Easy to customize setting and even create your own bookmarks .
They really screwed the pooch on this one .
The MAC Mini , wireless keyboard / mouse and a HDMI cable is all I need to get some real work done .##MAC_Mini##wireless_keyboard##mouse##HDMI_cable
I finally pulled the trigger and I am blown away by how much more I enjoy my computer tasks using the Mac Mini ! ! !
it has all the features that we expected and the price was good , working well so far .##features##price
I work as a designer and coder and I needed a new buddy to work with , not gaming .##gaming
I was told that it seems to be a multi , component failure .
The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad .##operating_system
I am very happy with my first Mac .
Easy to set up and go !##set_up
I ca n't believe how quiet the hard drive is and how quick this thing boots up .##hard_drive
The only issue came when I tried scanning to the mac .
The machine is speedy and efficient .
I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point .##price_point
A *big* upgrade from my 13 2006 macbook .
It 's just what we were looking for and it works great .
Having a Mac certainly makes life easier .
It 's so quick and responsive that it makes working on a computer so much more pleasurable !
The old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
It works fine , and all the software seems to run pretty well .##works##software
For this purpose , it 's great .
Could n't have asked for more !
I 'm using this computer for word processing , web browsing , some gaming , and I 'm learning programming .##word_processing##web_browsing##gaming
It certainly does , but you rarely hear any of your friends with Mac 's complain about anything .
My wife was so excited to open the box , but quickly came to see that it did not function as it should .
I do n't have any technical pearls to share .
I wanted a computer that was quite , fast , and that had overall great performance .##performance
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag .##"Help"
All I can say is I am impressed .
It suddenly can not work .
It did everything we expected !
Harddrive was in poor condition , had to replace it .
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner .##switch
It 's a nice little gadget .
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini .##instructions
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming , otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks .##Intel_4000_graphics
It 's macbook pro and there is no discusion about it .
I 'm hoping the rest of the features will be the signature quality of apple .##features##signature_quality
I use it mostly for content creation Audio , video , photo editing and its reliable .##content_creation_Audio##video##photo_editing
It is the best all around Mac .
Screen is bright and gorgeous .##Screen
Also is portable and reliable .
The only solution is to turn the brightness down , etc .##brightness
It is not an easy decision to purchase a used or even good as new laptop but I am very satisfied .
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .##applications
It is robust , with a friendly use as all Apple products .
Even if you do n't do business , thats okay , it 's incredibly fast .
It is fast and easy to use .##use
This was absolutely annoying !
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up##i5_processor
But for those of you that do n't have a mac and are still on the PC 's this is a good foot in the door into mac .
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help##built_in_features
and it fits in my briefcase with ease
Nice screen , keyboard works great !##screen##keyboard
Still not bad for 22000 .
I was amazed at how fast the delivery was .##delivery
Good computer and fast .
I 've installed to it additional SSD and 16Gb RAM .##16Gb_RAM
The memory was gone and it was not able to be used .##memory
Its pretty much fire it up and go .
It works great and I am so happy I bought it .
Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop .
I like the design and ease of use with the keyboard , plenty of ports .##design##use##keyboard##ports
Apple is living up to its name with the mini and , for our needs , it 's perfect .
it definitely beats my old mac and the service was great .##service
I went from a Macbook to this Mac Mini and this was a great upgrade !
Web browsing is very quick with Safari browser .##Web_browsing##Safari_browser
It could n't have been a better decision .
I like the lighted screen at night .
It 's great to have a solid Mac in the living room .
It is really easy to use and it is quick to start up .##use##start_up
I 've lived with the crashes and slow operation and restarts .##operation
Very light and easily maneuverable .
USB3 Peripherals are noticably less expensive than the ThunderBolt ones .##USB3_Peripherals
This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far .
And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty problems .##warranty
I am not happy with my purchase
It 's fast , light , and is perfect for media editing , which is mostly why I bought it in the first place .
However , the machine itself left a bit to be desired .
The battery lasts as advertised give or take 15-20 minutes , and the entire user experience is very elegant .##battery
I spent months looking for a good laptop for me and I finally found it !
$ 99900 Tax free .
Thanks for the fast shipment and great price .##price
! Excelent performance , usability , presentation and time response .##performance##usability##presentation
The smaller size was a bonus because of space restrictions .##size
I blame the Mac OS .##Mac_OS
But for now , this laptop is still a workhorse .
In fact I still use manyASPECT0 Appleworks , FileMaker Pro , Quicken , Photoshop etc !##Appleworks
It 's small but powerful , light but strong , elegant and beautiful In resume , it 's a Mac ! .
I like the operating system .##operating_system
I wish I would have taken the plunge years ago .
I love the form factor .
I have n't used the product long enough to write a detailed technical review .
It 's fast at loading the internet .##internet
So much faster and sleeker looking .
I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time .
Unfortunately , it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April .##runs_XP##dropping_support
Its seen in movies , sitcoms , prominent important people carry and use them and they are GREAT !
First off , I really do like my MBP once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around , and the overall build is great eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on .##OS##build##keyboard
Does exactly what I bought it 4 .
Buy the Mac Mini it 's a terribly great machine .
It is made of such solid construction and since I have never had a Mac using my iPhone helped me get used to the system a bit .##construction##system
I love this piece of equipment , It will be hard to go back to other type of laptop after using a MacBook Pro .
Very nice unibody construction .##unibody_construction
Very disappointed with Apple .
This Macbook Pro is fast , powerful , and runs super quiet and cool .##runs
***The review below is no longer relevant , Apple has fixed the issue .
It 's ok but does n't have a disk drive which I did n't know until after I bought it .##disk_drive
There is no HDMI receptacle , nor is there an SD card slot located anywhere on the device .##HDMI_receptacle
It really is very light compared to other computers .
It came in brand new and works perfectly .
This machine is A-mazing .
It should n't happen like that , I do n't have any design app open or anything .##design_app
MY TRACKPAD IS NOT WORKING .
I just hope this expensive laptop does n't go dead like my friendsit did last him 5 good years before it bit the dust .
Considering another computer should be out of the question
It looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .
Its worth every Penny .
Price was higher when purchased on MAC when compared to price showing on PC when I bought this product .##Price##price
This was a great deal for a decked out MacBook Pro .
Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off .##system##power
Get this instead , you wo n't be sorry .
The configuration is perfect for my needs .##configuration
and the speakers is the worst ever .##speakers
I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked .
Its the best , its got the looks , super easy to use and love all you can do with the trackpad ! .##looks##use##trackpad
It 's fast , quiet , incredibly small and affordable compared to other Mac models .
Web surfuring is smooth and seamless .##Web_surfuring
It was so exciting for me to unwrapp my new mac .
I 'm overall pleased with the interface and the portability of this product .##interface##portability
so when I had the money to buy one I bought other things insteada 700 laptop and some extra stuff with it .
This item is a beautiful piece , it works well , it is easy to carry and handle .##works##carry##handle
See retired recently and decided that she wanted a laptop .
It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues , relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime .##hardware_(keyboard)##performance##battery
I 'm no regular customer I hate wasting my time with hellos and how can I help you 's .
Runs good and does the job , ca n't complain about that !##Runs
It 's silent and has a very small footprint on my desk .
I have nothing to regret from this new product .
The exterior is absolutely gorgeous .
Have one myself and Love it !
It has a very high performance , just for what I needed for .##performance
This is especially disheartening when Apple prides itself as the choice of creative professionals .
Apple is aware of this issue and this is either old stock or a defective design involving the intel 4000 graphics chipset .##design##intel_4000_graphics_chipset
Stop living in the stone age and buy a mac , you will not be sorry at all ! !
OSX Mountain Lion soon to upgrade to Mavericks .##OSX_Mountain_Lion
Apple hit a home run here .
I just bought the new MacBook Pro , the 13 model , and I ca n't believe Apple keeps making the same mistake with regard to USB ports .##USB_ports
So glad I have gone this route ! !
It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid .
It is the perfect size and speed for me .##size##speed
I am so addict to this laptop .
THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIFIC ! !##CUSTOMER_SERVICE
Trashed it when I spilled a latte on it while writing at a cafe .
My last laptop was a 17 ASUS gaming machine , which performed admirably , but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life , I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome , not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago .
However , it did not have any scratches , ZERO battery cycle count pretty surprised , and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly .##battery##hardware
After fumbling around with the OS I started searching the internet for a fix and found a number of forums on fixing the issue .##OS##internet
I could n't be more pleased .
And as for all the fancy finger swipes - I just gave up and attached a mouse .##mouse
I needed a laptop with big storage , a nice screen and fast so I can photoshop without any problem .##storage##screen
I like coming back to Mac OS but this laptop is lacking in speaker quality compared to my $ 400 old HP laptop .##OS##speaker_quality
It is much better than the Acer ultrabook I had before .
Shipped very quickly and safely .
I finally own a piece of computing equipment that I do n't want to take a baseball bat and destroy .##bat
The thunderbolt port is awesome !##thunderbolt_port
User friendly , fast and high tech It is amazing !
The performance is definitely superior to any computer I 've ever put my hands on .##performance
It 's great for streaming video and other entertainment uses .
Apple did a great job .
I like the design and its features but there are somethings I think needs to be improved .##design##features
There were small problems with Mac office .
It is extremely fast and very compact .
I understand I should call Apple Tech Support about any variableswhich is my purpose of writing this con as variables could be a bigger future problem .##Tech_Support
I ordered my 2012 mac mini after being disappointed with spec of the new 27 Imacs .##spec
It still works and it 's extremely user friendly , so I would recommend it for new computer user and also for those who are just looking for a more efficient way to do things
Its fast , easy to use and it looks great .##use
but Office can be purchased IF I ever need a laptop again I am for sure purchasing another Toshiba ! !
I have n't tried the one with retina display Maybe in the future .##retina_display
You can read all about the details of this marvelous computer on wikipedia .
Performance is much much better on the Pro , especially if you install an SSD on it .##Performance
Note , however , that any existing MagSafe accessories you have will not work with the MagSafe 2 connection .##MagSafe_2_connection
If you get a lemon I have two thirds of my Macs , you have to send it in for repairs several times before they will replace it , even if they have numerous problems with the same version of their computers .
The only thing I dislike is the touchpad , alot of the times its unresponsive and does things I do n't want it too , I would recommend using a mouse with it .##touchpad##mouse
Yeah , it 's super expensive .
The Mac mini is about 8x smaller than my old computer which is a huge bonus and runs very quiet , actually the fans are n't audible unlike my old pc##Mac_mini##runs##fans
MAYBE The Mac OS improvement were not The product they Want to offer .##Mac_OS_improvement
It came before the day it supposed to which is great .
I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem .##transition
It 's absolutely wonderful and worth the price !##price
It 's a good fix , in my opinion .
I am please with the products ease of use ; out of the box ready ; appearance and functionality .##use##functionality
Buying a Mac Mini would allow me to make the transition .
Before I begin , I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer , I am not an Apple fanboy .
its by far faster and more stable then my PC .
I purchased a MacBook Pro and this to replace a couple of HP units that I was using .
you will not regret it , promise you !
Moving from a PC to Mac has never been easier , and I 'm glad that I did it .
Perfect for all my graphic design classes I 'm taking this year in college , -
Have used only Macs for years .
Being a tech savvy , APPLE , product loving person , I 'm glad I finally got the MacBook Pro !##tech_savvy
I was always against them but now I buying one I 'll never go back to PC .
I will not be using that slot again .
I think that was a great decision to buy
The OS is fast and fluid , everything is organized and it 's just beautiful .##OS
It will make life so much easier next semester , just wish I had it last semester ! !
I paid for a new laptop , but was sent a used one .
Searched it on amazon and on bestbuy .
I bought this one for my 11 year old and the MacBook Air for my 9 year old .
I bought it for college and so far it 's amazing !
They are simpler to use .##use
It was at my door in less than 24 hours .
It 's also very pricey but you just have to tell yourself it 's an investment and that it 's gon na last you a long time .
It was getting old and I needed a new school computer .
! so nice stable fast now i got my SSD ! .
I love apple but unlike others That does not prevent me to not be honest about how i like it and if its good or not .
So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys .
It is a great computer for that and I have to say I 'm happy I switched .
Also , in using the built-in camera , my voice recording for my vlog sounds like the interplanetary transmissions in the Star Wars saga .##built-in_camera
Overall a nice computer .
You can imagine that an expensive item as a laptop will not be left on your front steps , it needs signature to pove that you received it .
I love the quick start up .
Yes , he is a self professed Mac snob .
You just can not beat the functionality of an Apple device .##functionality
Yet my mac continues to function properly .
Graphics are much improved .##Graphics
Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase , Build Quality , Seriously , you ca n't beat a unibody construction .##Build_Quality
It 's the mid 2012 version .
It provides much more flexibility for connectivity .##connectivity
I want the portability of a tablet , without the limitations of a tablet and that 's where this laptop comes into play .##portability
I have had many , many issues with PC 's in the past and I 'm finally glad to have joined the Mac revolution !
Mac tutorials do help .
When it broke I wanted another Acer and chose the V5 .
The technical support was not helpful as well .##technical_support
I got the new adapter and there was no change .
so i called technical support .##technical_support
Nothing about it that i do n't love , apple always makes a great product .
I saved about $ 100 plus tax ordering on Amazon and since I have prime , it arrived overnight for just $ 399 more .
Came with iPhoto and garage band already loaded .##iPhoto##garage_band
It 's all a bit magical .
Logic board utterly fried , cried , and laid down and died .##Logic_board
It is BLAZING fast !
The sound was crappy even when you turn up the volume still the same results .##sound##volume
ive never had a problem with it !
I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro , and each have their own strengths and weaknesses .
OSX Lion is a great performerextremely fast and reliable .##OSX_Lion
Best commuter I have ever owned .
What can I say , It 's an Apple .
Having heard from friends and family about how reliable a Mac product is , I never expected to have an application crash within the first month , but I did .##application
The Macbook pro 's physical form is wonderful .
I have an iPhone , and iPad , so it just made sense to finish off the platform by adding the Mini .
Not super light but still a good one .
The Mini 's body has n't changed since late 2010 and for a good reason .##body
The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple 's previous laptops .##unibody_construction
i had to return it for a replacement .
It was wonderful deal for the wonderful product .
It completely supports my home business and personal life .
3D rendering slows it down considerably .
Got this Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion for my wife .##OS_X_Mountain_Lion
I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date .
Every day I had this computer , something failed on it .
fast , great screen , beautiful apps for a laptop ; priced at 1100 on the apple website ; amazon had it for 1098+ tax , plus i had a 10 % off coupon from amazon-ASPECT3 me 998 plus tax 1070 OTD !##screen##apps
1244 seconds to boot .##boot
All the ports are much needed since this is my main computer .##ports
The Like New condition of the iMac MC309LL/A on Amazon is at $ 900+ level only , and it is a Quad-Core 2.5 GHz CPU similar to the $ 799 Mini , with Radeon HD 6750M 512MB graphic card this mini is integrated Intel 4000 card , and it even comes with wireless Apple Keyboard and Mouse , all put together in neat and nice package .##Quad-Core_2.5_GHz_CPU##Radeon_HD_6750M_512MB_graphic_card##Intel_4000_card##Keyboard##Mouse
Put a cover on it and is a little better but that is my only complaint .
Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously .##gestures
This mac does come with an extender cable and I 'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac .##cable
This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook .
The 2.9ghz dual-core i7 chip really out does itself .##2.9ghz_dual-core_i7_chip
My life has been enriched since I have been using Apple products .##life
i FINALLY DID IT AND THIS MACHINE IS THE WAY TO GO !
It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me .
The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things .
So noise is reduced at least 50 % and the heat is much better , now it does n't feel hot but warm .##noise
Not sure on Windows 8 .##Windows
It 's a lottery at this point as I have read that other have received new ones with the same problem .
My one complaint is that there was no internal CD drive .##CD_drive
This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights .##hard_drive##network_lights
This is the first time for me to use a Mac and I 'm really happy with the move .
No complaints for an Apple product .
The new MacBook is lightyears ahead of my old white plastic MacBook circa 2006 .
I would say that 85 % of the design industry is Mac for good reason .##design_industry
I was having a though time deciding between the 13 MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13 Both baseline models , priced at 1,200 $ retail
The last new mac I bought was in 1998 .
There are reviews that speak to a few possible glitches but , I have n't seen them yet .
Not too expense and has enough storage for most users and many ports .##storage
I am very satisfied with the mini .
The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .##audio_volume##background_activity
I am going to college next year and I needed a cheaper , quality computer for the goals I am trying to pursue .##quality
In the short time of one month since the 2012 Mac Mini was released there are well over 1000 posts regarding this issue and the numbers keep rising .
It is lightweight and the perfect size to carry to class .##size##carry
If you have to ask you do n't own a Mac and your just not in the know .
All my devises talk to each other .
Why not 5 stars ?
Very Very Highly Recommended .
? I am only interested in the 154 McBook Pro Model # MD103LL/A .
I do n't know why I did n't make the switch soonero ya because it 's expensive .
I was given a demonstration of Windows 8 .##Windows_8
The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students .
Their products , including the MBP , are beautiful , sleek and clever .
The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities .
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some settings .
Runs very smoothly .##Runs
Perfect -- thanks so .
Also , it hardly ever crashes .
I was so excited to get this in the mail i nearly gave myself a heart attack .
Boot-up slowed significan'tly after all Windows updates were installed .##Windows_updates
More likely it will require replacing the logic board once they admit they have a problem and come up with a solution .##logic_board
When i finally held it in my hands i kissed it , yes i did .
It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet , word processing , graphic design and gaming .##tasks##word_processing##graphic_design##gaming
This computer is not cheap and represent an achievement for me .
I like the Mini Mac it was easy to setup and install , but I am learning as I go and could use a tutorial to learn how to use some of the features I was use to on the PC especially the right mouse click menu .##setup##features##mouse_click_menu
GET THIS MACHINE
It 's shiny and it 's pretty .
Runs real quick .##Runs
All the above aside this machine ROCKS !
Buy the separate RAM memory and you will have a rocket !##RAM_memory
Since the machine 's slim profile is critical to me , that was a problem .
Bottom line , if you can afford it , get a Mac !
I finally made the leap after my Gateway crapped out on me .
WiFi capability , disk drive and multiple USB ports to connect scale and printers was all that was required .##WiFi_capability##disk_drive##USB_ports
The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down the nail slot on the card can not be accessed , if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue , but its not .##SD_card_reader##nail_slot
Soft touch , anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws .##laser_cut_precision
Simple details , crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden , bulky sticker filled laptops .
First of all yes this is a mac and it has that nice brushed aluminum .
Who makes a laptop that ca n't rest on your lap ?
After all was said and done , I essentially used that $ 450 savings to buy 16GB of RAM , TWO Seagate Momentus XT hybrid drives and an OWC upgrade kit to install the second hard drive .##16GB_of_RAM##drives##hard_drive
The Dell Inspiron is fast and has a number pad on the keyboard , which I miss on my Apple laptops .##number_pad##keyboard
wow the new macbook pro hanged as i tried to type this review .
The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer .
I was concerned that the downgrade to the regular hard drive would make it unacceptably slow but I need not have worried , this machine is the fastest I have ever owned .##hard_drive
This one still has the CD slot .
No HDMI port .##HDMI_port
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours .
Customization on mac is impossible .
I hope this review helps .
However , you have to adjust yourself to what it will do , not what you want it to do .
I am replacing the HD with a Micron SSD soon .##HD
Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive .##right_click_button
Far superior to my MacBook .
The SuperDrive is quiet .
It was quite easy .
The power plug has to be connected to the power adaptor to charge the battery but wo n't stay connected .##power_plug##power_adaptor##battery
I decided to buy a few notebooks for my nephews for Xmas .
The battery was completely dead , in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside .##battery
This is no exception .
if yo like practicality this is the laptop for you .
The OS is great .##OS
I have had a black macbook since 2007 .
I tried several monitors and several HDMI cables and this was the case each time .##monitors##HDMI_cables
CONS , Price is a bit ridiculous , kinda heavy .##Price
If that is the case , then I am completely happy
10/10 five stars would recommend .
The troubleshooting said it was the AC adaptor so we ordered a new one .
I fell in love with my machine , and it was pampered .
Fan only comes on when you are playing a game .##Fan
Which it did not have , only 3 USB 2 ports .##USB_2_ports
No startup disk was not included but that may be my fault .##startup_disk
There is no "tools" menu .##"tools"_menu
It is very fast and has everything that I need except for a word program .##word_program
Needs a CD/DVD drive and a bigger power switch .##CD/DVD_drive##power_switch
It is the best laptop ever ! ! !
My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want Windows 8 .##Windows_7##Windows_8
Was skeptical about buying an electronic item online but it turned out to be a positive experience .
Not a scratch or mark on it .
Easy to install also small to leave anywhere at your bedroom also very easy to configure for ADSl cable or wifi .##wifi
Words can not express how much I love my new Mac .
The speakers could have been better but it was n't a deal breaker this is a great little laptop love it ! .##speakers
The item received was exactly as identified .
Its everything mac offers .
Nice packing .
Besides being elegant , the MacBooks are durable .
I switched to this because I wanted something different , even though I miss windows .##windows
Yes , the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops .
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore , Apple does n't even offer it anymore !
I also wanted Windows 7 , which this one has .##Windows_7
At first , I feel a little bit uncomfortable in using the Mac system .##Mac_system
I am used to computers with windows so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around .
They replaced it and so far so good .
It just works out of the box and you have a lot of cool software included with the OS .##software##OS
Good in every aspect .
its as advertised on here it works great and is not a waste of money ! .
Replaced this one with my mac that was stolen , its a great computer .
Just be careful ; you always have to give up some good stuff for others .
Runs like a champ .##Runs
Really greatWell let me start at the beginning .
Premium price for the OS more than anything else .##Premium_price_for_the_OS
This was a gift for my grand son .
I was a little concerned about the touch pad based on reviews , but I 've found it fine to work with .##touch_pad
I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27 iMac and while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers .
The sound as mentioned earlier is n't the best , but it can be solved with headphones .##sound
The track pad is a bit squirrely at times sometimes too sensitive , and sometimes a bit unresponsive , but it 's usable .##track_pad
However , the experience was great since the OS does not become unstable and the application will simply shutdown and reopen .##OS##application
Then only FOUR months later , my great MacBook pro FAILED .
If you ask me , for this price it should be included .##price
The battery is not as shown in the product photos .##battery
Even though I could have gotten a pc twice the speed for the same price I still think there 's nothing like a Mac .##speed##price
Seems a much more economical way to get into Apple than their other computers .
Shipping was quick and product described was the product sent and so much more .
I 'm so disgusted that I wasted my money on this product .
All you get is a box and a computer .
the retina display display make pictures i took years ago jaw dropping .##retina_display_display
Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i 've had it .
The Mac Mini is probably the simplest example of compact computing out there .
Instead , I 'll focus more on the actual performance and feature set of the hardware itself so you can make an educated decision on which Mac to buy .##performance##feature_set##hardware
My bag just got a little lighter .
I 'm Not exagerating when I say this computer is perfecti It is ! ! .
This machine is flawless , fast , and classy .
Other ports include FireWire 800 , Gigabit Ethernet , MagSafe port , Microphone jack .##Gigabit_Ethernet##MagSafe_port##Microphone_jack
I stayed up half the night enjoying my new MacBook Pro .
This laptop is a 100 times better than a Chromebook !
Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone playing steam games causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .##system##steam_games
At $ 1899 to start , this is no cheap machine .
Chatting with Acer support , I was advised the problem was corrupted operating system files .##Acer_support##operating_system_files
It 's been a couple weeks since the purchase and I 'm struggle with finding the correct keys but that was expected .##keys
Many people complain about the new OS , and it 's urgent for Apple to fix it asap !##OS
Now that I have upgraded to Lion I am much happier about MAC OS and have just bought an iMac for office .##MAC_OS
User upgradeable RAM and HDD .##RAM
But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player .##CD/DVD_player
I might have read it incorrectly , but better safe than sorry right ?
The ultimate graduation gift .
The RAM memory is good but should have splurged for 8Mb instead of 4Mb .##RAM_memory
was debating to buy one for months , checked out different stuff on youtube , and read different articles and debates , I just did n't really wan na spend the money but Im glad that I did .
I love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention PC 's require .
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with os.x and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .##windows##windows
I am an Info Sys major in college , so I started researching this issue on my own .
Solution , it turned out to be pretty simple .
With the softwares supporting the use of other OS makes it much better .##softwares##OS
Still have n't solved this .
I then upgraded to Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" .##Mac_OS_X_10.8_"Mountain_Lion"
It is EXTREMELY fast and never lags .
I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues .
I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .##performance
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24" LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .##external_24"_LCD_screen##screen_size
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .
Just beware no DVD slot so when I went to install software I had on CD I could n't .##install_software
I bought it to be able to dedicate a small , portable laptop to my writing and was surprised to learn that I needed to buy a word processing program to do so .##word_processing_program
This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ("Ivy Bridge") , not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has .##runs
Actually , I think I was intimidated by the change from a PC .
No Cd Rom in the new version there 's no way I 'm spending that kind of money on something has less features than the older version .##features
Definitely worth spending the money on it .
I have three words , Piece of Junk !
the volume is really low to low for a laptopwas not expectin t volume to be so lowan i hate that about this computer##volume
Fits all my personal needs .
I 'm the pro-active type so I went off and did some preventative fixes .
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it .
I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about .
I got this at an amazing price from Amazon and it arrived just in time .##price
Every time I log into the system after a few hours , there is this endlessly frustrating process that I have to go through .##system
The majority of the reviews seem to be for the 133 MacBook Pro Model # MD101LL/A .
Put a SSD and use a 21" LED screen , this set up is silky smooth !##21"_LED_screen##set
I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .##case##external_power_supply##size
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .##wireless_mouse##pad##key_board
When considering a Mac , look at the total cost of ownership and not just the initial price tag .##look##price_tag
Has all the other features I wanted including a VGA port , HDMI , ethernet and 3 USB ports .##features##VGA_port##HDMI##ethernet##USB_ports
A great college tool !
The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip .##rubber_pads
I called apple and no solution .
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .##price
I was really happy because it is a much better price on amazoncom than it was in the Mac store .##price
The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up .
The nicest part is the low heat output and ultra quiet operation .##operation
I am paying apple to kill my self and my wallet .
NO STAR FOR THIS TRASH [ .
I will upgrade the ram myself because with this model you can you can do it later on .##ram
The price is 200 dollars down .##price
this Mac Mini does not have a built-in mic , and it would seem that its Mac OS 10.9 does not handle external microphones properly .##built-in_mic##Mac_OS_10.9##external_microphones
A lot of features and shortcuts on the MBP that I was never exposed to on a normal PC .##features
Was n't sure if I was going to like it much less love it so I went to a local best buy and played around with the IOS system on a Mac Pro and it was totally unique and different .##IOS_system
Quietest laptop I have ever owned .
air has higher resolution but the fonts are small .##resolution
again this is just my personal honest opinion .
If you have much higher expectations than that I would look elsewhere .
working with Mac is so much easier , so many cool features .##features
I 'm going to buy a logitevh c270 .
Very happy with my purchase .
I like the brightness and adjustments .
I 'M SO HAPPY WITH MY macbook pro !
I only wish this mac had a CD/DVD player built in .
The only thing I miss is that my old Alienware laptop had backlit keys .##keys
The only thing I miss are the "Home/End" type keys and other things that I grew accustomed to after so long .##"Home/End"_type_keys
So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .##Microsoft_Word
It is more than enough computer to keep up with the needs of a high school student .
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .##memory##speed
The speed , the simplicity , the design it is lightyears ahead of any PC I have ever owned .##speed##simplicity##design
I love everything about this computer .
I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple .
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .##battery_life##display##downloading_apps
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .##screen##software##operating_system
While we struggle with all the crashes and viruses , the kids computers stay consistent and so we caved in and bought one for buisness !
I do n't want to RUN a computer ; I want to USE a computer .
i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it .##plastic_case
I also made a recovery USB stick .##recovery_USB_stick
Being a PC user for many years to switch to a Mac I will not go back .
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sound tinny .##bass##sound
I do admit it is pricey but the saying is really true with this MacBook Pro Laptop You get what you pay for .
I 've almost have bought every generation of MacMinis since 2005 , and this one has n't let me down .
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .##built_quality
I am loving the fast performance also .##performance
I had to return it because it would n't even start .
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface courtesy of the Mac OS and the range is poor .##Bluetooth_interface##Mac_OS##range
Great deal on an amazing lap top !
If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up .##start_menu
Best money I ever spent .
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .##RAM
But I did n't want to spend another thousand on a laptop since my work already provides me with a PC .
Fine if you have a touch screen .##touch_screen
can never go wrong with apple products .
As far as user type , I dabble in everything from games WoW to Photoshop , but nothing professionally .##games_WoW_to_Photoshop
It doesnt get hot like my PC , with technology always at the tip of our fingertips anytime I forget how to do something i just google it .
I re-seated the "WLAN" card inside and re-installed the LAN device drivers .##"WLAN"_card##LAN_device_drivers
This by far beats any computer out on the market today built well , battery life AMAZING .##battery_life
I have n't used it for anything high tech yet , but I love it already .
The OS is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .##OS
I had to get Apple Customer Support to correct the problem .##Apple_Customer_Support
Ideal for someone on the go or for a high school students .
A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 in PC enabled with USB3 was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .##feature##MAC_OS##Windows_7
I like iTunes , the apparent security , the Mini form factor , all the nice graphics stuff .##iTunes##apparent_security##Mini##graphics
The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card .##card_reader##card
This flaw unfortunately detracts from everything else Apple got right with the Mini .
After replacing the spinning hard disk with an ssd drive , my mac is just flying .##spinning_hard_disk##ssd_drive
I know some people complained about HDMI issues but they released a firmware patch to address that issue .##HDMI
With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs .##specs
Added an iMac about 2 years later .
packing and everything was perfect
I will not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends
I called Toshiba where I gave them the serial number and they informed me that they were having issues with the mother boards .##mother_boards
I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty , related to the graphics card .##Mother_Board##graphics_card
It also comes with 4G of RAM but if you 're like me you want to max that out so I immediately put 8G of RAM in her and I 've never used a computer that performs better .##4G_of_RAM##RAM
This computer is also awesome for my sons virtual home schooling .
Cost is more as compared to other brands .
also excellent operating system size and weight for optimal mobility excellent durability of the battery the functions provided by the trackpad is unmatched by any other brand- .##operating_system_size##weight##battery##functions##trackpad
This hardware seems to be better than the iMac in that it is n't $ 1400 and smaller .##hardware
I 'm done with WinDoze computers .
I 've had it for about 2 months now and found no issues with software or updates .##software
the latest version does not have a disc drive .##disc_drive
Screen , although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous .##Screen

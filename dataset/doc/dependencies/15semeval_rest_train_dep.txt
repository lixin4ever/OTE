Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer. We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude. They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table. The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny. After all that, they complained to me about the small tip. Avoid this place!####used->dep->Judging	Judging->nmod->posts	posts->case->from	posts->amod->previous	used->nsubj->this	used->xcomp->place	place->mark->to	place->cop->be	place->det->a	place->amod->good	used->cc->but	used->conj->not	not->dep->longer	longer->advmod->any	arrived->nsubj->We	arrived->parataxis->were	were->expl->there	were->nsubj->four	four->nmod->us	us->case->of	arrived->dep->empty	empty->nmod->noon	noon->case->at	empty->nsubj->place	place->det->the	empty->cop->was	empty->cc->and	empty->conj->acted	acted->nsubj->staff	staff->det->the	acted->advcl->imposing	imposing->mark->like	imposing->nsubj->we	imposing->aux->were	imposing->nmod->them	them->case->on	empty->cc->and	empty->conj->rude	rude->nsubj->they	rude->cop->were	rude->advmod->very	brought->nsubj->They	brought->neg->never	brought->xcomp->noodles	noodles->nsubj->us	noodles->advmod->complimentary	brought->conj->ignored	ignored->dobj->requests	requests->amod->repeated	ignored->nmod->sugar	sugar->case->for	brought->cc->and	brought->conj->threw	threw->dobj->dishes	dishes->nmod:poss->our	threw->nmod->table	table->case->on	table->det->the	lousy->nsubj->food	food->det->The	lousy->cop->was	lousy->conj->sweet	sweet->advmod->too	lousy->cc->or	lousy->conj->salty	salty->advmod->too	lousy->cc->and	lousy->conj->tiny	tiny->nmod:npmod->portions	portions->det->the	complained->nmod->that	that->case->After	that->det:predet->all	complained->nsubj->they	complained->nmod->me	me->case->to	complained->nmod->tip	tip->case->about	tip->det->the	tip->amod->small	Avoid->dobj->place	place->det->this
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good. Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn. The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world. The wine list is interesting and has many good values. For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.####good->ccomp->eaten	eaten->nsubj->I	eaten->aux->have	eaten->nmod->Saul	Saul->case->at	Saul->appos->times	times->amod->many	good->nsubj->food	food->det->the	good->cop->is	good->advmod->always	good->advmod->consistently	good->advmod->outrageously	restaurant->nsubj->Saul	restaurant->cop->is	restaurant->det->the	restaurant->amod->best	restaurant->nmod->Street	Street->case->on	Street->compound->Smith	Street->cc->and	Street->conj->Brooklyn	Brooklyn->case->in	amazing->nsubj->confit	confit->det->The	confit->compound->duck	amazing->cop->is	amazing->advmod->always	amazing->cc->and	amazing->conj->world	world->nsubj->terrine	terrine->det->the	terrine->amod->foie	terrine->compound->gras	terrine->nmod->figs	figs->case->with	world->cop->was	world->advmod->out	world->case->of	world->det->this	interesting->nsubj->list	list->det->The	list->compound->wine	interesting->cop->is	interesting->cc->and	interesting->conj->has	has->dobj->values	values->amod->many	values->amod->good	eat->nmod->price	price->case->For	price->det->the	eat->nsubj->you	eat->aux->can	eat->neg->not	eat->dobj->well	well->det->this	well->nmod->Manhattan	Manhattan->case->in
I was very disappointed with this restaurant. Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away. I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested. Food was okay, nothing great. Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.  I/we will never go back to this place again.####disappointed->nsubj->I	disappointed->cop->was	disappointed->advmod->very	disappointed->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->with	restaurant->det->this	asked->nsubj->Ive	asked->dep->wrapped	wrapped->nsubj->attendant	attendant->det->a	attendant->compound->cart	attendant->nmod->leaf	leaf->case->for	leaf->det->a	leaf->amod->lotus	wrapped->dobj->rice	wrapped->cc->and	wrapped->conj->replied	replied->nsubj->she	replied->compound:prt->back	replied->dobj->rice	replied->cc->and	replied->conj->walked	walked->advmod->just	walked->compound:prt->away	had->nsubj->I	had->xcomp->ask	ask->mark->to	ask->dobj->times	times->nmod:poss->her	times->nummod->three	ask->advcl->came	came->mark->before	came->nsubj->she	came->advmod->finally	came->advmod->back	came->nmod->Ive	Ive->case->with	Ive->det->the	Ive->compound->dish	Ive->acl->requested	okay->nsubj->Food	okay->cop->was	okay->dep->great	great->nmod:npmod->nothing	dry->nsubj->fun	fun->compound->Chow	dry->cop->was	dry->parataxis->greasy	greasy->nsubj->mai	mai->compound->pork	mai->compound->shu	greasy->cop->was	greasy->advmod->more	more->case->than	greasy->advmod->usually	greasy->cc->and	greasy->conj->had	had->xcomp->share	share->mark->to	share->dobj->table	table->det->a	share->nmod->family	family->case->with	family->amod->loud	loud->cc->and	loud->conj->rude	go->nsubj->I/we	go->aux->will	go->neg->never	go->compound:prt->back	go->nmod->place	place->case->to	place->det->this	go->advmod->again
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!

Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street. Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated. I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible. Can't wait wait for my next visit.####make->nsubj->time	time->det->Every	time->nmod->York	York->case->in	York->compound->New	York->dep->I	make->xcomp->point	point->nsubj->it	point->det->a	point->acl->visit	visit->mark->to	visit->dobj->Saul	Saul->compound->Restaurant	Saul->nmod->Street	Street->case->on	Street->compound->Smith	cooked->nsubjpass->Everything	cooked->auxpass->is	cooked->advmod->always	cooked->nmod->perfection	perfection->case->to	cooked->parataxis->excellent	excellent->nsubj->service	service->det->the	excellent->cop->is	cooked->parataxis->cool	cool->nsubj->decor	decor->det->the	cool->cc->and	cool->conj->understated	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->special	special->det->the	special->compound->duck	special->compound->breast	special->nmod->visit	visit->case->on	visit->nmod:poss->my	visit->amod->last	had->cc->and	had->conj->incredible	incredible->nsubj->it	incredible->cop->was	wait->aux->Ca	wait->neg->n't	wait->nsubj->wait	wait->nmod->visit	visit->case->for	visit->nmod:poss->my	visit->amod->next
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.'  And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back.  The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here. The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree. I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt). Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari. The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.####give->dep->had	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->eyes	eyes->nmod:poss->my	eyes->nmod->place	place->case->on	place->det->this	had->advcl->promising	promising->dobj->myself	give->nsubj->I	give->aux->will	give->nmod:tmod->day	day->nummod->one	give->iobj->it	give->dobj->try	try->det->a	hate->cc->And	hate->nsubj->I	hate->xcomp->say	say->mark->to	say->dobj->this	hate->cc->but	hate->conj->doubt	doubt->nsubj->I	doubt->ccomp->go	go->nsubj->I	go->aux->'ll	go->advmod->ever	go->advmod->back	sweet->ccomp->averagethe	averagethe->nsubj->food	food->det->The	averagethe->cop->is	averagethe->advmod->very	averagethe->ccomp->sweet	sweet->nsubj->stuff	stuff->compound->Thai	stuff->compound->fusion	sweet->cop->is	sweet->dep->bit	bit->det->a	sweet->advmod->too	sweet->nsubj->thing	thing->det->every	thing->acl:relcl->serve	serve->nsubj->they	sweet->cop->is	sweet->advmod->too	sweet->advmod->here	special->nsubj->thing	thing->det->The	thing->amod->only	thing->acl:relcl->enjoyed	enjoyed->nsubj->I	enjoyed->advmod->moderately	special->cop->was	special->nmod:poss->their	special->compound->Grilled	special->compound->Chicken	special->nmod->Puree	Puree->case->with	Puree->compound->Edamame	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->had	had->neg->never	had->dobj->Edamame	Edamame->acl->pureed	pureed->advcl->thought	thought->mark->before	thought->cc->but	thought->nsubj->I	thought->ccomp->innovative	innovative->nsubj->it	innovative->cop->was	innovative->cc->and	innovative->conj->tasty	Edamame->acl:relcl->used	used->aux->could	used->aux->'ve	used->dobj->salt	salt->amod->more	more->nmod:npmod->bit	bit->det->a	waste->advmod->Anyways	waste->advcl->neighborhood	neighborhood->mark->if	neighborhood->nsubj->you	neighborhood->cop->'re	neighborhood->case->in	neighborhood->det->the	neighborhood->acl->eat	eat->mark->to	eat->dobj->food	food->amod->good	waste->nsubj->I	waste->aux->would	waste->neg->n't	waste->dobj->time	time->nmod:poss->my	time->acl->trying	trying->xcomp->find	find->mark->to	find->dobj->something	find->advmod->rather	find->dep->go	go->nmod->street	street->case->across	street->det->the	go->nmod->Tamari	Tamari->case->to	thobut->nsubj->decor	decor->det->The	thobut->cop->is	thobut->compound->night	thobut->acl:relcl->need	need->nsubj->they	need->advmod->REALLY	need->xcomp->clean	clean->mark->to	clean->ccomp->vent	vent->nsubj->that	vent->nmod->ceilingits	ceilingits->case->in	ceilingits->det->the	ceilingits->amod->un-appetizing	un-appetizing->advmod->quite	need->cc->and	need->conj->kills	kills->dobj->effort	effort->nmod:poss->your	effort->acl->make	make->mark->to	make->dobj->look	look->det->this	look->compound->place	look->amod->sleek	sleek->cc->and	sleek->conj->modern
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing. What's the difference between the two? Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request! The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share! We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!####ate->nsubj->We	ate->advmod->outside	ate->nmod->bar	bar->case->at	bar->nmod:poss->Haru	Haru->case->'s	bar->compound->Sake	ate->advcl->overflowing	overflowing->mark->because	overflowing->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->nmod:poss->Haru	Haru->case->'s	overflowing->advmod->next	next->dep->door	overflowing->aux->was	What->cop->'s	What->nsubj->difference	difference->det->the	difference->nmod->two	two->case->between	two->det->the	extensive->nsubj->list	list->nmod:poss->Their	list->compound->sake	extensive->cop->was	extensive->cc->but	extensive->conj->looking	looking->nsubj->we	looking->aux->were	looking->nmod->Haze	Haze->case->for	Haze->compound->Purple	Haze->acl:relcl->listed	listed->nsubjpass->which	listed->auxpass->was	listed->neg->n't	listed->cc->but	listed->conj->made	made->nmod->us	us->case->for	made->nmod->request	request->case->upon	good->nsubj->roll	roll->det->The	roll->amod->spicy	roll->compound->tuna	good->cop->was	good->advmod->unusually	good->cc->and	good->conj->appetizer	appetizer->nsubj->tempura	tempura->det->the	tempura->compound->rock	tempura->compound->shrimp	appetizer->cop->was	appetizer->amod->awesome	appetizer->amod->great	appetizer->nmod->share	share->case->to	went->nsubj->We	went->dep->30	30->dep->9	9->case->around	30->nmod->Friday	Friday->case->on	Friday->det->a	30->cc->and	30->conj->died	died->nsubj->it	died->aux->had	died->advmod->down	down->nmod:npmod->bit	bit->det->a	down->advcl->then	then->case->by	down->advcl->great	great->mark->so	great->nsubj->service	service->det->the	great->cop->was

i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience. (i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..)  the food is decent. however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check. i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience. well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience.  the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.####eaten->nsubj->i	eaten->aux->have	eaten->dobj->handful	handful->advmod->here	handful->det->a	handful->nmod->times	times->case->of	eaten->nmod->reason	reason->case->for	reason->neg->no	reason->nmod->convenience	convenience->case->besides	convenience->amod->sheer	hang->nsubj->i	hang->advmod->out	hang->cc->and	hang->conj->live	hang->conj->neighborhood	neighborhood->case->in	neighborhood->det->the	decent->nsubj->food	food->det->the	decent->cop->is	service->advmod->however	service->nsubj->it	service->cop->'s	service->det->the	service->acl:relcl->leaves	leaves->nsubj->that	leaves->dobj->taste	taste->det->a	taste->amod->bad	taste->nmod->mouth	mouth->case->in	mouth->nmod:poss->my	make->ccomp->happen	happen->nsubj->i	happen->xcomp->have	have->mark->to	have->dobj->policy	policy->det->a	policy->acl:relcl->goes	goes->nsubj->that	goes->compound:prt->along	goes->nmod->bit	bit->case->with	bit->det->a	bit->amod->little	bit->nmod->self-respect	self-respect->case->of	self-respect->acl:relcl->includes	includes->nsubj->which	includes->xcomp->letting	letting->neg->not	letting->ccomp->intimidate	intimidate->nsubj->waiter	waiter->det->a	intimidate->dobj->me	make->nsubj->ie	make->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->me	feel->xcomp->bad	bad->dep->asking	asking->nmod->trivialities	trivialities->case->for	trivialities->nmod->water	water->case->like	trivialities->cc->or	trivialities->conj->check	check->det->the	know->nsubj->i	know->dep->busy	busy->nsubj->you	busy->cop->were	busy->advmod->too	busy->ccomp->showing	showing->compound:prt->off	showing->dobj->shirt	shirt->nmod:poss->your	shirt->amod->vintage	shirt->compound->tee	showing->cc->and	showing->conj->looking	looking->xcomp->bored	know->cc->but	know->conj->i	i->nsubj->agenda	agenda->nmod:poss->my	i->cop->is	i->acl:relcl->'m	'm->advmod->here	'm->xcomp->eat	eat->mark->to	eat->cc->and	eat->conj->enjoy	eat->dobj->company	company->det->the	company->nmod->friends	friends->case->of	company->acl->seeking	seeking->dobj->experience	experience->det->a	experience->amod->pleasant	told->advmod->well	told->parataxis->find	find->nsubj->i	find->aux->did	find->neg->n't	find->dobj->it	find->advmod->there	find->cc->and	find->conj->trust	told->nsubj->i	told->aux->have	told->dobj->everyone	everyone->acl:relcl->think	think->nsubj->i	think->aux->can	think->nmod->experience	experience->case->of	experience->case->about	experience->nmod:poss->my	walked->nsubj->i	i->det->the	i->amod->last	i->compound->time	walked->advcl->looked	looked->mark->by	looked->nsubj->it	looked->dobj->hmmm	hmmm->amod->empty	empty->advmod->pretty

I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose. It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery. The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned. The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice. We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.####tend->nsubj->I	tend->xcomp->judge	judge->mark->to	judge->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->compound->sushi	judge->nmod->urchin	urchin->case->by	urchin->nmod:poss->its	urchin->compound->sea	urchin->acl:relcl->heavenly	heavenly->nsubj->which	heavenly->cop->was	heavenly->nmod->sushi	sushi->case->at	sushi->acl->rose	melted->nsubj->It	melted->nmod->mouth	mouth->case->in	mouth->nmod:poss->my	mouth->amod->little	mouth->cc->and	mouth->conj->consistency-not	consistency-not->det->the	consistency-not->amod->perfect	consistency-not->amod->fishy	fishy->advmod->too	fishy->conj->creamy	fishy->cc->and	fishy->conj->buttery	buttery->advmod->slightly	seemed->nsubj->sushi	sushi->det->The	seemed->xcomp->fresh	fresh->advmod->pretty	seemed->cc->and	seemed->conj->proportioned	proportioned->auxpass->was	proportioned->advmod->adequately	good->nsubj->rice	rice->det->The	rice->nmod->ration	ration->case->to	ration->compound->fish	good->cop->was	good->advmod->also	good->parataxis->try	try->nsubj->they	try->aux->did	try->neg->n't	try->xcomp->overpack	overpack->mark->to	overpack->dobj->rice	rice->det->the	took->nsubj->We	took->dobj->advanatage	advanatage->nmod->deal	deal->case->of	deal->det->the	deal->amod->half	deal->compound->price	deal->compound->sushi	deal->nmod->saturday	saturday->case->on	took->advcl->it	it->mark->so	it->nsubj->it	it->cop->was	it->advmod->well	it->case->worth
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently. She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.

Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot. Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility. The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced. The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality). I will be going back and heartily recommend it!####hunted->aux->Having	hunted->compound:prt->around	hunted->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->for	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->amod->quiet	restaurant->amod->romantic	romantic->cc->yet	romantic->conj->expensive	expensive->neg->not	expensive->advmod->hideously	restaurant->acl:relcl->stumbled	stumbled->nsubj->I	stumbled->nmod->reviews	reviews->case->across	reviews->nmod->Lanterna	Lanterna->case->for	Lanterna->compound->La	stumbled->cc->and	stumbled->conj->gave	gave->iobj->it	gave->dobj->shot	shot->det->a	stepping->dep->Quite	Quite->advmod->simply	stepping->nsubj->it	stepping->cop->'s	stepping->mark->like	stepping->compound:prt->out	stepping->nmod->Manhattan	Manhattan->case->of	Manhattan->cc->and	Manhattan->conj->haven	haven->case->into	haven->det->a	haven->nmod->tranquility	tranquility->case->of	attentive->nsubj->service	service->det->The	attentive->cop->was	attentive->cc->yet	attentive->conj->unimposing	attentive->conj->better	better->nsubj->food	food->det->the	better->cop->was	better->advmod->far	better->nmod->restaurants	restaurants->case->than	restaurants->amod->many	restaurants->amod->notorious	restaurants->nmod->Midtown	Midtown->case->in	attentive->cc->and	attentive->conj->extensive	extensive->nsubjpass->list	list->det->the	list->compound->wine	extensive->auxpass->is	extensive->cc->and	extensive->conj->priced	priced->advmod->well	penny->nsubj->menu	menu->det->The	menu->compound->Prix	menu->compound->Fixe	penny->cop->is	penny->case->worth	penny->det->every	penny->cc->and	penny->conj->get	get->nsubj->you	get->advmod->enough	enough->advmod->more	enough->case->than	get->nmod->quantity	quantity->dep->both	quantity->case->in	quantity->cc->AND	quantity->conj->quality	going->nsubj->I	going->aux->will	going->aux->be	going->advmod->back	going->cc->and	going->conj->recommend	recommend->advmod->heartily	recommend->dobj->it
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood. It is terrific, as is the value. $6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled. I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great. Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison. Go hungry and enjoy.####had->nsubj->I	had->aux->'ve	had->dobj->buffet	buffet->det->the	buffet->compound->lunch	had->advcl->Chennai	Chennai->mark->at	Chennai->dobj->couple	couple->det->a	couple->nmod->times	times->case->of	times->acl:relcl->neighborhood	neighborhood->advmod->when	neighborhood->nsubj->I	neighborhood->aux->have	neighborhood->cop->been	neighborhood->case->in	neighborhood->det->the	terrific->nsubj->It	terrific->cop->is	terrific->advcl->value	value->mark->as	value->cop->is	value->det->the	food->nsubj->6	6->dep->$	6->cc->and	6->conj->there	food->cop->is	food->amod->tasty	tasty->advmod->much	food->appos->all	all->nmod->it	it->case->of	all->amod->fresh	fresh->cc->and	fresh->conj->refilled	refilled->advmod->continually	vegetarian->nsubj->I	vegetarian->cop->am	vegetarian->neg->not	vegetarian->det->a	vegetarian->cc->but	vegetarian->dep->great	great->nsubj->dishes	dishes->advmod->almost	dishes->det:predet->all	dishes->det->the	great->cop->were	is->advmod->Frankly	is->advcl->compare	compare->advmod->when	compare->nsubj->you	compare->ccomp->have	have->dobj->what	have->nsubj->you	have->aux->can	have->dobj->here	here->nmod->lunch	lunch->case->for	here->cc->versus	here->conj->McDs	here->cc->or	here->conj->shops	shops->amod->many	many->advmod->so	shops->amod->other	shops->compound->sandwich	shops->nmod->city	city->case->in	city->det->the	is->expl->there	is->nsubj->comparison	comparison->neg->no	Go->xcomp->hungry	Go->cc->and	Go->conj->enjoy
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it. I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing. The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not. The kitchen however, is almost always slow. Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't. The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.####good->nsubj->food	food->det->The	good->advmod->here	good->cop->is	good->advmod->rather	good->cc->but	good->conj->only	good->advcl->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->you	like->xcomp->wait	wait->mark->to	wait->nmod->it	it->case->for	like->nsubj->I	like->dobj->somosas	somosas->det->the	somosas->conj->chai	somosas->cc->and	somosas->conj->chole	chole->det->the	like->cc->but	like->conj->dissapointing	dissapointing->nsubj->dhosas	dhosas->det->the	dhosas->cc->and	dhosas->conj->dhal	dissapointing->cop->were	dissapointing->compound->kinda	nice->dep->varys	varys->nsubj->service	service->det->The	varys->nmod->day	day->case->from	varys->nmod->day	day->case->to	varys->advmod->sometimes	nice->nsubj->they	nice->cop->'re	nice->advmod->very	nice->cc->and	nice->conj->not	not->advmod->sometimes	slow->nsubj->kitchen	kitchen->det->The	kitchen->advmod->however	slow->cop->is	slow->advmod->almost	slow->advmod->always	specify->advmod->Also	specify->advcl->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->you	like->ccomp->spicy	spicy->nsubj->food	food->nmod:poss->your	spicy->xcomp->do	do->nsubj->its	do->dep->bland	bland->advmod->rather	do->mark->if	do->nsubj->you	do->neg->n't	pretty->nsubj->ambience	ambience->det->The	pretty->cop->is	pretty->cc->and	pretty->conj->nice	pretty->nmod->conversation	conversation->case->for	pretty->advcl->best	best->mark->so	best->nsubj->lunch	lunch->det->a	lunch->amod->casual	best->advmod->here	best->aux->would	best->advmod->probably	best->cop->be
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday. If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer. Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening. The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.####went->advmod->Just	went->advmod->here	went->nmod->girlfriends	girlfriends->case->for	girlfriends->nmod:poss->my	went->nsubj->bday	bday->amod->23rd	have->advcl->river	river->mark->If	river->nsubj->you	river->aux->'ve	river->advmod->ever	river->cop->been	river->case->along	river->det->the	river->nmod->Weehawken	Weehawken->case->in	have->nsubj->you	have->dobj->idea	idea->det->an	idea->nmod->top	top->case->of	top->det->the	top->nmod->view	view->case->of	idea->acl:relcl->has	has->nsubj->house	house->det->the	house->compound->chart	has->xcomp->offer	offer->mark->to	Add->nmod->service	service->case->to	service->det->that	service->amod->great	service->cc->and	service->conj->food	food->amod->great	Add->nmod->price	price->case->at	price->det->a	price->amod->reasonable	Add->cc->and	Add->conj->have	have->nsubj->you	have->xcomp->beginning	beginning->nsubj->yourself	beginning->det->the	beginning->nmod->evening	evening->case->of	evening->det->a	evening->amod->great	incredible->nsubj->dessert	dessert->det->The	dessert->compound->lava	dessert->compound->cake	incredible->cop->was	incredible->cc->and	incredible->conj->recommend	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->dobj->it
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro. This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair. The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way. However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!####bistro->advcl->step	step->mark->Once	step->nsubj->you	step->nmod->Cosette	Cosette->case->into	bistro->nsubj->you	bistro->cop->'re	bistro->advmod->miraculously	bistro->case->in	bistro->det->a	bistro->amod->small	bistro->amod->off-the-beaten	bistro->compound->path	bistro->compound->Parisian	cozy->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->This	restaurant->amod->tiny	cozy->cop->is	cozy->advmod->as	cozy->dep->gets	gets->mark->as	gets->nsubj->it	cozy->nmod->flair	flair->case->with	flair->det->that	flair->amod->certain	flair->compound->Parisian	average->nsubj->food	food->det->The	average->cop->was	average->nmod->above-average	above-average->case->to	above-average->dep->soup	soup->det->the	soup->amod->French	soup->compound->Onion	soup->acl->filling	filling->advmod->yet	filling->advcl->impressive	impressive->neg->not	impressive->advmod->overly	average->cc->and	average->conj->brilliant	brilliant->dep->desserts	desserts->det->the	brilliant->neg->not	brilliant->nmod->way	way->case->in	way->det->any	go->advmod->However	go->nmod->ambience	ambience->case->for	ambience->det->the	go->cc->and	go->conj->consider	consider->dobj->food	food->det->the	consider->advmod->just	go->nsubj->companion	companion->det->a	companion->nmod->trip	trip->case->for	trip->det->a	trip->nmod->world	world->case->across	world->det->the
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week. IT WAS HORRIBLE. The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!

This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn. The pizza is overpriced and soggy. Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.

I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow. The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.

As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place. This place is the most Japanese it can ever get. The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese. This place is worth an one-hour drive. I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.####lived->nmod->native	native->case->As	native->det->a	native->amod->Japanese	lived->nsubj->I	lived->aux->'ve	lived->nmod->area	area->case->in	area->det->the	area->amod->Tristate	area->nmod->years	years->case->for	years->nummod->8	8->advmod->over	lived->cc->but	lived->conj->amazed	amazed->nsubjpass->I	amazed->auxpass->was	amazed->advmod->so	so->advmod->just	amazed->nmod->place	place->case->at	place->det->this	Japanese->nsubj->place	place->det->This	Japanese->cop->is	Japanese->det->the	Japanese->advmod->most	Japanese->acl:relcl->get	get->nsubj->it	get->aux->can	get->advmod->ever	Japanese->nsubj->signs	signs->det->The	signs->conj->menus	menus->det->the	menus->compound->specials	signs->conj->food	signs->cc->and	signs->conj->waitstaff	waitstaff->advmod->even	waitstaff->det:predet->all	waitstaff->det->the	Japanese->cop->are	Japanese->compound->ALL	Japanese->compound->TOTALLY	drive->nsubj->place	place->det->This	drive->cop->is	drive->case->worth	drive->det->an	drive->amod->one-hour	coming->nsubj->I	coming->aux->am	coming->advmod->so	coming->advmod->again	again->advmod->back	again->advmod->here	again->advmod->much	much->advmod->as	much->advcl->can	can->mark->as	can->nsubj->I
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere. My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story. Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter. Decent wine at reasonable prices. Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience. Our teenage kids love it, too.####gem->nsubj->Leon	gem->cop->is	gem->det->an	gem->compound->East	gem->compound->Village	gem->amod->casual	casual->cc->but	casual->conj->hip	gem->nmod->fare	fare->case->with	fare->amod->prepared	prepared->advmod->well	fare->amod->basic	fare->amod->French	fare->compound->bistro	gem->appos->specials	specials->amod->good	specials->appos->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->a	atmosphere->amod->warm	warm->cc->and	warm->conj->lively	enjoy->nsubj->wife	wife->nmod:poss->My	wife->cc->and	wife->conj->I	enjoy->advmod->always	enjoy->dobj->staff	staff->det->the	staff->amod->young	young->dep->trained	trained->neg->not	trained->advmod->well	well->advmod->always	trained->cc->but	trained->conj->friendly	friendly->advmod->nevertheless	staff->acl:relcl->have	have->nsubj->whom	whom->dep->all	whom->case->of	have->dobj->story	story->det->a	Sit->nmod->weather	weather->case->outside	weather->case->in	weather->det->the	weather->amod->warm	Sit->advmod->inside	inside->nmod->winter	winter->case->for	winter->amod->cozy	wine->amod->Decent	wine->nmod->prices	prices->case->at	prices->amod->reasonable	dozens->aux->Have	dozens->cop->been	dozens->nmod->times	times->case->of	dozens->cc->and	dozens->conj->failed	failed->neg->never	failed->xcomp->enjoy	enjoy->mark->to	enjoy->dobj->experience	experience->det->the	love->nsubj->kids	kids->nmod:poss->Our	kids->amod->teenage	love->dobj->it	love->advmod->too
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori. This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood. The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions. You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare. I'm partial to the Gnocchi.####get->ccomp->decide	decide->nsubj->Everytime	decide->nsubj->I	decide->xcomp->try	try->mark->to	try->dobj->place	place->det->another	try->nmod->UES	UES->case->on	UES->det->the	get->nsubj->I	get->xcomp->angry	angry->ccomp->go	go->mark->that	go->nsubj->I	go->aux->did	go->neg->n't	go->advmod->just	go->nmod->Pomodori	Pomodori->case->to	Pomodori->compound->Zucchero	place->nsubj->This	place->cop->is	place->advmod->far	far->case->by	place->nmod:poss->my	place->amod->favorite	place->nmod->neighborhood	neighborhood->case->in	neighborhood->det->the	excellent->nsubj->service	service->det->The	excellent->cop->is	excellent->dep->great	great->nsubj->decor	decor->det->the	great->cop->is	excellent->cc->and	excellent->conj->delicious	delicious->nsubj->food	food->det->the	delicious->cop->is	delicious->cc->and	delicious->conj->comes	comes->nmod->portions	portions->case->in	portions->amod->large	pay->nsubj->You	pay->aux->'ll	pay->dobj->double	double->nmod:npmod->least	least->case->at	pay->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->at	restaurant->det->any	restaurant->amod->other	restaurant->amod->Italian	restaurant->nmod->city	city->case->in	city->det->the	pay->cc->and	pay->conj->compare	compare->nsubj->most	compare->advmod->still	compare->aux->do	compare->neg->n't	partial->nsubj->I	partial->cop->'m	partial->nmod->Gnocchi	Gnocchi->case->to	Gnocchi->det->the

Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too . With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored . The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down . It's all about the food !!####is->ccomp->hit	hit->nsubj->Thailand	Thailand->compound->Planet	hit->aux->has	hit->advmod->always	hit->cop->been	hit->det->a	hit->nmod->me	me->case->with	hit->parataxis->go	go->nsubj->I	go->xcomp->there	there->advmod->usually	there->dep->sushi	sushi->case->for	sushi->det->the	hit->dep->great	great->nsubj->which	great->cop->is	is->nsubj->food	food->det->the	food->compound->thai	is->xcomp->excellent	excellent->advmod->too	eat->nmod->variety	variety->case->With	variety->det->the	variety->amod->great	variety->nmod->menu	menu->case->on	menu->det->the	eat->nsubj->I	eat->advmod->and	and->advmod->often	often->advmod->here	and->advmod->never	eat->dep->get	get->xcomp->bored	greatest->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->The	greatest->cop->is	greatest->neg->n't	greatest->det->the	greatest->cc->but	greatest->conj->suppose	suppose->nsubj->I	suppose->ccomp->'s	's->mark->that	's->ccomp->keep	keep->advmod->how	keep->nsubj->they	keep->dobj->prices	prices->det->the	keep->compound:prt->down	all->nsubj->It	all->cop->'s	all->nmod->food	food->case->about	food->det->the
I went there with my friend last saturday. first it took us a long time to find the place. we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers. but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section. then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi. those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh. they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.####went->nsubj->I	went->advmod->there	went->nmod->friend	friend->case->with	friend->nmod:poss->my	went->nmod:tmod->saturday	saturday->amod->last	took->advmod->first	took->nsubj->it	took->iobj->us	took->dobj->time	time->det->a	time->amod->long	time->acl->find	find->mark->to	find->dobj->place	place->det->the	tired->nsubj->we	tired->cop->were	tired->cc->and	tired->conj->cold	tired->advcl->got	got->advmod->when	got->nsubj->we	got->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->to	restaurant->det->the	tired->parataxis->sat	sat->advmod->then	sat->nsubj->we	sat->compound:prt->down	sat->xcomp->begin	begin->mark->to	begin->xcomp->ordering	ordering->dobj->appetizers	were->cc->but	were->advcl->looked	looked->advmod->when	looked->nsubj->we	looked->nmod->menu	menu->case->at	menu->det->the	were->parataxis->were	were->expl->there	were->neg->n't	were->nsubj->lot	lot->det->a	lot->nmod->choices	choices->case->of	were->nsubj->most	most->nmod->them	them->case->of	were->dep->dumplings	dumplings->nmod->section	section->case->in	section->det->the	section->compound->appetizer	ordered->advmod->then	ordered->nsubj->we	ordered->dobj->rolls	rolls->det->a	rolls->compound->dinosaur	rolls->cc->and	rolls->conj->sashimi	sashimi->amod->white	sashimi->compound->tuna	big->nsubj->rolls	rolls->det->those	big->cop->were	big->cc->but	big->conj->good	good->neg->not	big->cc->and	big->conj->fresh	fresh->nsubj->sashimi	fresh->cop->was	fresh->neg->n't	dry->nsubj->they	dry->cop->were	dry->cc->and	dry->conj->disgusting	dry->ccomp->finish	finish->nsubj->i	finish->aux->did	finish->neg->n't	finish->advmod->even	finish->dobj->piece	piece->nmod:poss->my	piece->amod->first

First went here to enjoy their garden terrace. The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed. The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table. Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm. Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value. It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area. Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.####went->nsubj->First	went->advmod->here	went->xcomp->enjoy	enjoy->mark->to	enjoy->dobj->terrace	terrace->nmod:poss->their	terrace->compound->garden	amazing->nsubj->food	food->det->The	amazing->cop->was	amazing->cc->and	amazing->conj->prompt	prompt->nsubj->service	service->det->the	prompt->cop->was	prompt->cc->and	prompt->conj->helpful	prompt->cc->but	prompt->conj->over-bearing	over-bearing->neg->not	prompt->cc->or	prompt->conj->rushed	fix->ccomp->bet	bet->nsubj->Tartare	Tartare->det->The	Tartare->compound->Steak	bet->cop->is	bet->det->a	bet->amod->great	fix->nsubj->they	fix->dobj->it	fix->nmod->you	you->case->for	fix->nmod->table	table->case->at	table->det->the	warm->advmod->Admittedly	warm->nsubj->nights	nights->det->some	warm->advmod->inside	inside->nmod:npmod->restaurant	restaurant->det->the	warm->cop->were	warm->advmod->rather	warm->cc->but	warm->conj->part	part->nsubj->kitchen	kitchen->det->the	kitchen->amod->open	part->cop->is	part->nmod->charm	charm->case->of	charm->det->the	price->nsubj->selection	selection->amod->Great	selection->compound->wine	selection->appos->Gigondas	price->cop->is	price->case->worth	price->det->the	price->cc->and	price->conj->value	value->nsubj->champagne	champagne->det->the	champagne->compound->house	value->cop->is	value->det->a	value->amod->great	packed->nsubjpass->It	packed->aux->may	packed->auxpass->be	packed->dep->bit	bit->det->a	packed->nmod->weekends	weekends->case->on	packed->cc->but	packed->conj->good	good->nsubj->vibe	vibe->det->the	good->cop->is	good->cc->and	good->conj->food	food->nsubj->it	food->cop->is	food->det->the	food->amod->best	food->amod->French	food->acl:relcl->find	find->nsubj->you	find->aux->will	find->nmod->area	area->case->in	area->det->the	recommended->aux->Have	recommended->dobj->place	place->det->the	recommended->nmod->friends	friends->case->to	friends->dep->gets	gets->advmod->always	gets->dobj->response	response->amod->good

When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong. The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no... Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes.  Such a disappointment...

I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently. The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's. Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu. Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling. So eat fast and order a lot. Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!####live->nsubj->I	live->dobj->block	block->det->a	live->compound:prt->away	live->cc->and	live->conj->go	go->nmod->Patsy	Patsy->case->to	Patsy->case->'s	go->advmod->frequently	use->ccomp->delicious	delicious->nsubj->pizza	pizza->det->The	delicious->cop->is	use->nsubj->they	use->dobj->mozzarella	mozzarella->amod->fresh	mozzarella->nmod->cheese	cheese->case->instead	instead->mwe->of	cheese->det->the	cheese->amod->cheap	cheese->amod->frozen	cheese->amod->shredded	cheese->amod->common	common->nmod->most	most->case->to	most->nmod:poss->pizza	pizza->case->'s	nice->nsubj->complaints	complaints->nummod->Two	complaints->dep->stinks	stinks->nmod:poss->their	stinks->compound->appetizer	stinks->compound->selection	nice->nsubj->it	nice->aux->would	nice->cop->be	nice->xcomp->get	get->mark->to	get->ccomp->sticks	sticks->nsubj->mozzarella	mozzarella->det->some	sticks->nmod->menu	menu->case->on	menu->det->the	gets->advmod->Also	gets->advcl->thin	thin->mark->because	thin->nsubj->it	thin->cop->is	thin->advmod->so	gets->nsubj->it	gets->dobj->cold	cold->advmod->quickly	quickly->advmod->very	cold->cc->and	cold->conj->filling	filling->nmod:poss->its	filling->amod->that	that->neg->not	eat->advmod->So	eat->advmod->fast	eat->cc->and	eat->conj->order	order->dobj->lot	lot->det->a	Wait->ccomp->unappreciative	unappreciative->nsubj->staff	unappreciative->cop->is	unappreciative->advmod->blantently	unappreciative->nmod->business	business->case->of	business->nmod:poss->your	business->nmod->pie	pie->case->but	pie->nmod:poss->its	pie->det->the	pie->amod->best	pie->nmod->UWS	UWS->case->on	UWS->det->the

On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT. This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater. The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm. With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!

I grew up on these bagels. The staff is no nonsense. The food options rule. When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.

I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A.  Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action. I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni. ( For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite.)  He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN! Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc. The sake menu should not be overlooked! All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city. Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.####stumbled->nsubj->I	stumbled->nmod->walk-up	walk-up->case->upon	walk-up->det->this	walk-up->amod->second	walk-up->compound->floor	stumbled->nmod:tmod->Fridays	Fridays->nummod->two	Fridays->advmod->ago	stumbled->advcl->friends	friends->advmod->when	friends->nsubj->I	friends->cop->was	friends->case->with	friends->nummod->two	friends->nmod->town	town->case->in	friends->nmod->LA	LA->case->from	sat->advcl->lovers	lovers->cop->Being	lovers->amod->serious	lovers->compound->sushi	sat->nsubj->we	sat->nmod->bar	bar->case->at	bar->det->the	bar->compound->sushi	sat->xcomp->closer	closer->mark->to	closer->cop->be	closer->nmod->action	action->case->to	action->det->the	asked->nsubj->I	asked->dobj->chef	chef->det->the	chef->acl:relcl->recommends	recommends->dobj->what	recommends->nsubj->he	asked->cc->and	asked->conj->asked	asked->nsubj->he	asked->dobj->me	asked->advcl->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->I	like->dobj->Uni	Urchin->nmod->those	those->case->For	those->nmod->you	you->case->of	those->acl:relcl->know	know->nsubj->who	know->aux->do	know->neg->n't	Urchin->nsubj->Uni	Urchin->cop->is	Urchin->compound->Sea	Urchin->nmod->Japanese	Japanese->case->in	Japanese->acl:relcl->happens	happens->nsubj->which	happens->xcomp->favorite	favorite->mark->to	favorite->cop->be	favorite->nmod:poss->my	served->nsubj->He	served->xcomp->roll	roll->nsubj->me	roll->det->an	roll->compound->Uni	roll->compound->Hand	roll->acl:relcl->had	had->dobj->which	had->nsubj->I	had->neg->never	had->advmod->before	served->cc->and	served->conj->let	let->ccomp->tell	tell->nsubj->me	tell->dep->youIT	youIT->dep->HEAVEN	HEAVEN->cop->WAS	recommended->advcl->Urchin	Urchin->advmod->Aside	Urchin->case->from	Urchin->det->the	Urchin->compound->Sea	recommended->nsubj->chef	chef->det->the	recommended->dobj->assortment	assortment->det->an	assortment->nmod->fish	fish->case->of	fish->nmod->Tail	Tail->case->including	Tail->compound->Fatty	Tail->compound->Yellow	Tail->conj->Shrimp	Shrimp->compound->Boton	Tail->conj->Tuna	Tuna->compound->Blue	Tuna->compound->Fin	Tuna->compound->Torro	Tuna->compound->Fatty	Tail->conj->Eel	Eel->compound->Sea	Tail->conj->etc	overlooked->nsubjpass->menu	menu->det->The	menu->compound->sake	overlooked->aux->should	overlooked->neg->not	overlooked->auxpass->be	became->nsubj->All	All->nmod->all	all->case->in	all->appos->gem	gem->det->this	gem->amod->midtown	became->advmod->instantly	became->xcomp->one	one->nmod->restaurants	restaurants->case->of	restaurants->nmod:poss->my	restaurants->amod->favorite	restaurants->compound->sushi	became->nmod->city	city->case->in	city->det->the	Try->ccomp->rose	rose->nsubj->teriyaki	teriyaki->det->the	teriyaki->compound->lobster	teriyaki->cc->and	teriyaki->conj->the	rose->dobj->roll	roll->amod->special
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu. Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive. Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience). Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top. Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.####visited->nsubj->We	visited->dobj->Orsay	visited->nmod->Week	Week->case->during	Week->compound->NY	Week->compound->Restaurant	visited->cc->and	visited->conj->tried	tried->dobj->menu	menu->nmod:poss->their	menu->amod->$	$->compound->35	good->nsubj->Service	good->cop->was	good->advmod->very	good->conj->prompt	good->conj->attentive	good->cc->and	good->conj->non-intrusive	good->nsubj->Food	good->cop->was	good->advmod->very	good->advcl->well	well->case->as	good->xcomp->considering	considering->ccomp->tried	tried->mark->that	tried->nsubj->we	tried->dobj->selection	selection->det->the	selection->compound->budget	tried->advcl->wish	wish->mark->though	wish->nsubj->I	wish->dobj->belly	belly->det->the	belly->compound->pork	wish->ccomp->ordered	ordered->mark->that	ordered->nsubj->I	ordered->ccomp->roasted	roasted->cop->was	roasted->advmod->longer	longer->nmod:npmod->bit	bit->det->a	roasted->cc->so	roasted->conj->more	more->mark->that	more->nsubj->fat	more->cop->was	more->nmod->experience	experience->case->of	experience->det->a	experience->amod->melt-in-your-mouth	good->nsubj->selection	selection->compound->Wine	selection->compound->list	good->cop->is	good->cc->and	good->conj->filled	filled->nsubjpass->wine-by-the-glass	filled->auxpass->was	filled->advmod->generously	filled->nmod->top	top->case->to	top->det->the	pleasant->nsubjpass->decour	decour->amod->Traditional	decour->amod->French	pleasant->auxpass->was	pleasant->advcl->noisy	noisy->mark->though	noisy->nsubj->hall	hall->det->the	noisy->cop->was	noisy->advmod->rather	pleasant->conj->full	full->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->the	full->cop->was	pleasant->cc->and	pleasant->conj->had	had->nsubj->we	had->xcomp->raise	raise->mark->to	raise->dobj->voices	voices->nmod:poss->our	had->xcomp->able	able->mark->to	able->cop->be	able->xcomp->maintain	maintain->mark->to	maintain->dobj->conversation	conversation->det->a
I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square. To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok.  Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening. Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders. As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time. The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.####restaurant->ccomp->to	to->nsubj->I	to->aux->'ve	to->cop->been	to->nmod->Spice	Spice->case->at	Spice->compound->Cafe	Spice->advmod->probably	Spice->dep->times	times->nummod->5-8	restaurant->nsubj->it	restaurant->cop->is	restaurant->advmod->probably	restaurant->advmod->still	restaurant->det->the	restaurant->amod->best	restaurant->amod->Indian	restaurant->nmod->Square	Square->case->around	Square->compound->Union	varies->advcl->sum	sum->mark->To	sum->dobj->it	sum->compound:prt->up	varies->nsubj->Service	varies->advcl->good	good->case->from	varies->xcomp->mediorce	mediorce->mark->to	varies->advcl->waiter	waiter->dep->depending	waiter->mark->on	waiter->nsubj->which	waiter->ccomp->get	get->nsubj->you	varies->parataxis->Ok	Ok->advmod->generally	Ok->nsubj->it	Ok->cop->is	Ok->advmod->just	Ok->amod->average	prompt->nsubj->Seating	prompt->cop->is	prompt->advmod->always	prompt->advcl->fill	fill->mark->though	fill->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->the	fill->aux->does	fill->compound:prt->up	fill->nmod->evening	evening->case->in	evening->det->the	good->nsubj->Food	good->cop->is	good->advmod->usually	good->advmod->very	good->advcl->wondered	wondered->mark->though	wondered->advmod->ocasionally	wondered->nsubj->I	wondered->nmod->freshmess	freshmess->case->about	freshmess->nmod->vegatables	vegatables->case->of	vegatables->amod->raw	wondered->nmod->orders	orders->case->in	orders->compound->side	true->ccomp->slow	slow->advcl->noticed	noticed->mark->As	noticed->nsubj->reviewers	reviewers->amod->many	reviewers->amod->other	slow->nsubj->order	order->nmod:poss->your	slow->cop->is	slow->advmod->often	slow->xcomp->arrive	arrive->mark->to	true->nsubj->this	true->cop->is	true->advmod->particularly	true->nmod->evening	evening->case->in	evening->det->the	true->cc->but	true->conj->problem	problem->cop->is	problem->neg->not	problem->det->a	problem->nmod->time	time->case->during	time->compound->lunch	vibrant->nsubj->decor	decor->det->The	vibrant->cop->is	vibrant->cc->and	vibrant->conj->eye-pleasing	vibrant->nmod->boths	boths->case->with	boths->amod->several	boths->amod->semi-private	boths->nmod->side	side->case->on	side->det->the	side->amod->right	side->nmod->hall	hall->case->of	hall->det->the	hall->compound->dining	hall->acl:relcl->great	great->nsubj->which	great->cop->are	great->nmod->date	date->case->for	date->det->a
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye. The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad. I've never ordered anything else from their menu...there's no need to. It's simply the best meal in NYC. You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.####disappointed->nsubjpass->I	disappointed->aux->have	disappointed->neg->NEVER	disappointed->auxpass->been	disappointed->nmod->Eye	Eye->case->in	Eye->det->the	Eye->compound->Red	ordered->nsubj->time	time->det->The	time->amod->first	time->acl:relcl->went	went->nsubj->I	went->cc->and	went->conj->taken	taken->auxpass->was	taken->advmod->completely	taken->nmod->band	band->case->by	band->det->the	band->amod->live	band->compound->jazz	band->cc->and	band->conj->atmosphere	ordered->nsubj->I	ordered->dobj->Salad	Salad->det->the	Salad->compound->Lobster	Salad->compound->Cobb	ordered->nsubj->I	ordered->aux->'ve	ordered->neg->never	ordered->dobj->anything	anything->advmod->else	anything->nmod->need	need->case->from	need->nmod:poss->menuthere	menuthere->nmod:poss->their	menuthere->case->'s	need->neg->no	ordered->nmod->to	meal->nsubj->It	meal->cop->'s	meal->advmod->simply	meal->det->the	meal->amod->best	meal->nmod->NYC	NYC->case->in	go->nsubj->You	go->aux->can	go->neg->not	go->xcomp->wrong	go->nmod->Grill	Grill->case->at	Grill->det->the	Grill->compound->Red	Grill->compound->Eye
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant. We've lived in the area for more than 8 years. The restaurant is cute but not upscale. The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes. I would highly recommend it. It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.####miss->advcl->were	were->mark->If	were->nsubj->we	were->xcomp->move	move->mark->to	move->nmod->side	side->case->from	side->det->the	side->amod->upper	side->amod->east	miss->nsubj->we	miss->aux->would	miss->advmod->genuinely	miss->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->this	lived->nsubj->We	lived->aux->'ve	lived->nmod->area	area->case->in	area->det->the	area->nmod->years	years->case->for	years->nummod->8	8->advmod->more	more->mwe->than	upscale->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->The	upscale->cop->is	upscale->dep->cute	upscale->cc->but	upscale->conj->not	diamond->nsubj->food	food->det->The	diamond->cop->is	diamond->det->a	diamond->acl->rough	rough->case->in	diamond->parataxis->delicious	delicious->nsubj->food	food->det->the	delicious->cop->is	delicious->cc->and	delicious->conj->homemade	delicious->nmod->balance	balance->case->with	balance->det->the	balance->amod->perfect	balance->nmod->herbs	herbs->case->of	herbs->cc->and	herbs->conj->tomatoes	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->aux->would	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->dobj->it	one->nsubj->It	one->cop->'s	one->nmod->places	places->case->of	places->nmod:poss->our	places->amod->favorite	one->acl->eat	eat->mark->to	eat->nmod->NY	NY->case->in
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night. We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks. After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner. The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile. The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh. I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!####had->nsubj->We	had->dobj->time	time->det->a	time->amod->great	time->nmod->Pub	Pub->case->at	Pub->det->the	Pub->compound->Jekyll	Jekyll->cc->and	Jekyll->conj->hyde	had->nmod:tmod->night	night->amod->last	walking->nsubj->We	walking->aux->were	walking->nmod->village	village->case->around	village->det->the	walking->cc->and	walking->conj->went	went->nmod->place	place->case->into	place->det->this	went->nmod->drinks	drinks->advmod->just	drinks->case->for	drinks->det->some	sat->advcl->enjoying	enjoying->mark->After	enjoying->advmod->really	enjoying->dobj->ourselves	enjoying->nmod->bar	bar->case->at	bar->det->the	sat->nsubj->we	sat->compound:prt->down	sat->nmod->table	table->case->at	table->det->a	sat->cc->and	sat->conj->had	had->dobj->dinner	cool->nsubj->server	server->det->The	cool->cop->was	cool->advmod->really	cool->cc->and	cool->conj->served	served->xcomp->food	food->nsubj->us	food->nmod:poss->our	food->cc->and	food->conj->drinks	food->nmod->smile	smile->case->with	smile->det->a	made->nsubj->decor	decor->nmod:poss->place	place->det->The	place->case->'s	decor->cc->and	decor->conj->bathrooms	bathrooms->amod->hidden	made->nmod->laugh	laugh->case->for	laugh->det->a	laugh->amod->good	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->ccomp->visiting	visiting->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->this	visiting->cc->and	visiting->conj->having	having->dobj->dinner	recommend->cc->and	recommend->conj->drinks
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat. My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic. The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini. The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner. Please take my advice, go and try this place. Its located in greenewich village. You will not be disapointed at all.####place->advcl->type	type->mark->If	type->nsubj->you	type->cop->are	type->det->the	type->nmod->person	person->case->of	type->acl:relcl->likes	likes->nsubj->who	likes->xcomp->scared	scared->auxpass->being	scared->cc->and	scared->conj->entertained	place->nsubj->this	place->cop->is	place->det->a	place->amod->great	place->acl->go	go->mark->to	go->cc->and	go->conj->eat	thougt->nsubj->husband	husband->nmod:poss->My	husband->cc->and	husband->conj->I	thougt->ccomp->great	great->nsubj->it	great->aux->would	great->cop->be	great->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->nmod->Pub	Pub->case->to	Pub->det->the	Pub->compound->Jekyll	Jekyll->cc->and	Jekyll->conj->Hyde	go->nmod->anniversary	anniversary->case->for	anniversary->nmod:poss->our	thougt->cc->and	thougt->conj->fantastic	fantastic->nmod->surprise	surprise->case->to	surprise->nmod:poss->our	fantastic->nsubj->it	fantastic->cop->was	have->nsubj->The	have->nmod->beers	beers->case->over	beers->nummod->100	beers->amod->different	have->xcomp->offer	offer->mark->to	offer->dobj->guest	guest->compound->thier	offer->advcl->made	made->mark->so	made->nsubj->that	made->xcomp->happy	happy->nsubj->husband	husband->nmod:poss->my	happy->advmod->very	have->cc->and	have->conj->delicious	delicious->nsubj->food	food->det->the	delicious->cop->was	delicious->advcl->recommend	recommend->mark->if	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->aux->must	recommend->dobj->dish	dish->det->a	dish->acl:relcl->tortelini	tortelini->nsubj->it	tortelini->aux->must	tortelini->cop->be	tortelini->det->the	tortelini->compound->pumkin	great->nsubj->entertainment	entertainment->det->The	great->cop->was	great->ccomp->have	have->nsubj->they	have->dobj->shows	shows->acl:relcl->go	go->nsubj->that	go->compound:prt->on	go->nmod->dinner	dinner->case->through	dinner->case->out	dinner->det->the	take->discourse->Please	take->dobj->advice	advice->nmod:poss->my	take->conj->go	take->cc->and	take->conj->try	try->dobj->place	place->det->this	located->nsubj->Its	located->nmod->village	village->case->in	village->amod->greenewich	disapointed->nsubjpass->You	disapointed->aux->will	disapointed->neg->not	disapointed->auxpass->be	disapointed->nmod->all	all->case->at
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel. We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem. The bagel was huge. They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior. The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy). I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.####had->nsubj->time	time->nmod:poss->Our	time->amod->first	time->nmod->York	York->case->in	York->compound->New	York->cc->and	York->conj->we	had->xcomp->try	try->mark->to	try->dobj->Bagel	Bagel->det->a	Bagel->compound->New	Bagel->compound->York	dissappointed->nsubjpass->We	dissappointed->auxpass->were	dissappointed->neg->not	dissappointed->nmod->bit	bit->case->in	bit->det->the	bit->amod->least	dissappointed->nmod->gem	gem->case->by	gem->det->this	gem->amod->little	huge->nsubj->bagel	bagel->det->The	huge->cop->was	served->nsubjpass->They	served->auxpass->were	served->xcomp->warm	served->cc->and	served->conj->had	had->dobj->interior	interior->det->a	interior->amod->soft	interior->amod->fluffy	gets->nsubj->workers	workers->det->The	workers->acl:relcl->load	load->expl->there	load->advmod->also	load->advmod->absolutely	load->dobj->bagel	bagel->det->the	bagel->nmod->cheese	cheese->case->with	cheese->compound->cream	gets->dobj->messy	messy->det->a	messy->amod->little	loved->nsubj->I	loved->dobj->it	loved->cc->and	loved->conj->HIGHLY	HIGHLY->aux->would	HIGHLY->dobj->RECOMMEND
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was. When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests. I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster. Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips. I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.####time->nsubj->This	time->cop->was	time->nmod:poss->my	time->compound->frist	time->nmod->St	St->case->at	St->compound->Cafe	St->nmod:poss->Bart	Bart->case->'s	time->cc->and	time->conj->say	say->nsubj->I	say->aux->must	say->ccomp->delicous	delicous->advmod->how	delicous->ccomp->was	was->nsubj->food	food->det->the	food->cc->and	food->conj->service	service->det->the	think->advcl->called	called->advmod->When	called->nsubj->I	called->nmod:tmod->morning	morning->det->this	think->nsubj->I	think->aux->did	think->neg->n't	think->ccomp->able	able->nsubj->I	able->aux->would	able->cop->be	able->xcomp->get	get->mark->to	get->compound:prt->in	get->nmod->12	12->case->at	think->cc->but	think->conj->able	able->nsubj->I	able->cop->was	able->xcomp->get	get->mark->to	get->nmod->in	get->advmod->along	along->nmod->guests	guests->case->with	guests->nummod->four	guests->amod->other	have->nsubj->I	have->xcomp->recommend	recommend->mark->to	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->dobj->roll	roll->det->the	roll->compound->lobster	have->neg->not	not->nmod->mayo	mayo->case->to	mayo->amod->much	have->parataxis->tell	tell->nsubj->you	tell->aux->can	tell->ccomp->lobster	lobster->nsubj->it	lobster->cop->was	lobster->det->a	lobster->amod->fresh	chopped->ccomp->enjoyed	enjoyed->nsubj->guests	guests->amod->Other	enjoyed->dobj->pizza	chopped->nsubj->fe	fe->compound->santa	chopped->dobj->salad	salad->cc->and	salad->conj->fish	salad->cc->and	salad->conj->chips	recommend->dep->I	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->ccomp->food	food->nsubj->Bart	Bart->compound->Cafe	Bart->compound->St	food->cop->'s	food->case->for	food->nmod:poss->their	food->appos->service	service->det->the	service->amod->ambience	ambience->cc->and	ambience->conj->wonderful
All the staff is absolutely professional!!  I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes. But they do. (that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...)  If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT. There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).####professional->nsubj->staff	staff->det:predet->All	staff->det->the	professional->cop->is	professional->advmod->absolutely	see->nsubj->I	see->advmod->sometimes	see->ccomp->have	have->nsubj->waiters	waiters->det->the	have->aux->do	have->neg->n't	have->dobj->knowledge	knowledge->amod->enough	knowledge->nmod->dishes	dishes->case->of	dishes->nmod:poss->their	do->cc->But	do->nsubj->they	MUST->nsubj->that	MUST->cop->is	MUST->det->A	MUST->cc->but	MUST->conj->do	do->neg->not	do->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->every	do->aux->can	recommend->advcl->want	want->mark->If	want->nsubj->you	want->xcomp->dine	dine->mark->to	dine->nmod->party	party->case->with	party->amod->large	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->xcomp->make	make->mark->to	make->dobj->BASEMENT	BASEMENT->compound->reservation	's->expl->There	's->xcomp->nice	nice->cc->and	nice->conj->quiet	nice->conj->small	small->cc->but	small->conj->enough	enough->nmod->6	6->case->for	nice->cc->or	nice->conj->more
This restaurant was way overhyped. My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily. Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.

I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is. He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.

Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews. On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch. Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation. Salads were fantastic. Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great. Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me. We will be back.####Visited->xcomp->there	Visited->advcl->vacation	vacation->mark->while	vacation->case->on	Visited->cc->and	Visited->conj->reading	reading->dobj->reviews	reviews->det->the	fabulous->nmod->day	day->case->On	day->det->a	day->amod->hot	fabulous->nsubj->it	fabulous->cop->was	fabulous->xcomp->stop	stop->mark->to	stop->compound:prt->in	stop->cc->and	stop->conj->enjoy	enjoy->dobj->lunch	cute->nsubj->Ambience	cute->cop->is	cute->advmod->so	cute->cc->and	cute->conj->quaint	cute->dep->good	good->nmod->business	business->case->for	cute->advcl->vacation	vacation->mark->although	vacation->nsubj->we	vacation->cop->were	vacation->advmod->there	vacation->case->on	fantastic->nsubj->Salads	fantastic->cop->were	great->csubj->looking	looking->mark->Although	looking->nsubj->we	looking->aux->were	looking->nmod->lettuce	lettuce->case->for	lettuce->amod->regular	looking->cc->and	looking->conj->walnuts	walnuts->nsubj->some	walnuts->dobj->salads	salads->det->the	salads->acl:relcl->got	got->nsubj->we	great->cop->were	organic->nsubj->Ingredients	organic->cop->are	organic->acl:relcl->plus	plus->nsubj->which	plus->cop->is	plus->det->a	plus->amod->real	plus->nmod->me	me->case->for	be->nsubj->We	be->aux->will	be->advmod->back
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi. It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice. The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range. The Yellowtail was particularly good as well. I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu. In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.####sushi->nsubj->This	sushi->cop->is	sushi->det->some	sushi->amod->good	good->advmod->really	sushi->amod->inexpensive	costs->nsubj->It	costs->dep->2	2->dep->$	costs->dobj->extra	extra->dep->turn	turn->mark->to	turn->dobj->roll	roll->det->a	roll->amod->regular	turn->nmod->roll	roll->case->into	roll->det->an	roll->amod->inside-out	roll->cc->but	roll->conj->triples	triples->advmod->more	more->nmod:npmod->roll	roll->det->the	triples->case->than	triples->nmod->size	size->case->in	costs->cc->and	costs->conj->rice	rice->nsubj->that	rice->cop->'s	rice->neg->not	rice->advmod->just	rice->case->from	rice->det->the	huge->nsubj->roll	roll->det->The	roll->amod->spicy	roll->compound->Tuna	huge->cop->is	huge->cc->and	huge->advmod->probably	huge->conj->best	best->det->the	huge->ccomp->had	had->mark->that	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->'ve	had->nmod->range	range->case->at	range->det->this	range->compound->price	good->nsubj->Yellowtail	Yellowtail->det->The	good->cop->was	good->advmod->particularly	good->advcl->well	well->case->as	have->nsubj->I	have->dobj->reservations	reservations->nmod->all	all->case->about	all->dep->the	reservations->acl:relcl->eat	eat->nsubj->you	eat->aux->can	eat->dobj->deal	have->advmod->however	have->parataxis->limited	limited->nsubj->choices	choices->det->the	limited->cop->are	limited->advmod->fairly	limited->cc->and	limited->conj->order	order->nsubj->you	order->aux->can	order->advmod->probably	order->dobj->food	food->amod->more	order->advcl->eat	eat->mark->than	eat->nsubj->you	eat->aux->can	eat->nmod->$	$->case->for	$->advmod->less	less->mwe->than	$->nummod->18	eat->advcl->going	going->mark->by	going->advmod->just	going->compound:prt->off	going->dobj->menu	menu->det->the	place->nmod->event	event->case->In	event->det->any	place->nsubj->this	place->cop->is	place->det->a	place->acl:relcl->sure	sure->nsubj->I	sure->aux->'ll	sure->cop->be	sure->xcomp->stop	stop->mark->to	stop->advcl->again	again->case->by	sure->advcl->part	part->advmod->when	part->nsubj->I	part->cop->'m	part->case->in	part->det->this	part->nmod->town	town->case->of
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment. They have it all -- great price, food, and service. The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can. The food is prepared quickly and efficiently. And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each). The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well. This place is always very crowded and popular.####gets->nsubj->Wong	Wong->compound->Big	gets->dobj->Ups	Ups->amod->big	Ups->nmod->establishment	establishment->case->for	establishment->det->a	establishment->amod->fine	have->nsubj->They	have->dobj->it	it->advmod->all	it->conj->price	price->amod->great	it->conj->food	it->cc->and	it->conj->service	noisy->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->The	noisy->cop->is	noisy->cc->and	noisy->conj->walking	walking->nsubj->waiters	waiters->det->the	walking->aux->are	walking->advmod->literally	walking->advcl->doing	doing->mark->around	doing->dobj->things	doing->advmod->fast	fast->advmod->as	fast->advcl->can	can->mark->as	can->nsubj->they	prepared->nsubjpass->food	food->det->The	prepared->auxpass->is	prepared->advmod->quickly	quickly->cc->and	quickly->conj->efficiently	comes->cc->And	comes->nsubj->it	comes->advmod->all	comes->nmod->congee	congee->case->at	congee->det->a	congee->amod->reasonable	reasonable->advmod->very	congee->compound->price	congee->appos->noodles	comes->cc->and	comes->conj->$	$->nsubj->dishes	dishes->compound->rice	$->cop->are	$->advmod->no	$->advmod->more	more->mwe->than	$->nummod->3-6	$->dep->each	great->nsubj->takeout	takeout->det->The	great->cop->is	great->advmod->too	great->ccomp->give	give->mark->since	give->nsubj->they	give->dobj->tupperware	tupperware->amod->high	tupperware->compound->quality	give->advmod->as	as->mwe->well	crowded->nsubj->place	place->det->This	crowded->cop->is	crowded->advmod->always	crowded->advmod->very	crowded->cc->and	crowded->conj->popular

Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza. Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though). My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better. The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day. Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids. Overall I would recommend it and go back again. Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)####place->advmod->Right	Right->nmod->L	L->case->off	L->det->the	L->nmod->Brooklyn	Brooklyn->case->in	place->nsubj->this	place->cop->is	place->det->a	place->amod->nice	place->compound->cozy	place->nmod->pizza	pizza->case->with	pizza->amod->good	burnt->nsubj->Mine	burnt->cop->was	burnt->nmod:npmod->little	little->det->a	burnt->cc->but	burnt->conj->delicious	delicious->advmod->still	burnt->nmod->cheese	cheese->case->with	cheese->compound->goat	burnt->cc->and	burnt->conj->bitter	bitter->nsubj->raddichio	raddichio->compound->panchetta	bitter->cop->was	bitter->advmod->kind	kind->mwe->of	bitter->advmod->though	got->nsubj->friend	friend->nmod:poss->My	got->dobj->pizza	pizza->det->the	pizza->compound->mushroom	pizza->acl:relcl->tasted	tasted->nsubj->which	tasted->advmod->better	tasty->nsubj->sangria	sangria->det->The	tasty->cop->was	tasty->advmod->pretty	tasty->cc->and	tasty->conj->good	tasty->nmod->day	day->case->on	day->det->a	day->amod->hot	day->compound->muggy	guess->nsubj->Kind	Kind->nmod->place	place->case->of	place->det->a	place->amod->small	place->nmod->I	I->case->but	guess->advcl->busy	busy->mark->if	busy->nsubj->they	busy->cop->are	busy->neg->not	busy->advmod->too	busy->ccomp->able	able->aux->might	able->cop->be	able->xcomp->fit	fit->mark->to	fit->dobj->group	group->det->a	group->cc->or	group->conj->kids	recommend->advmod->Overall	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->aux->would	recommend->dobj->it	recommend->cc->and	recommend->conj->go	go->compound:prt->back	go->advmod->again	Coming->nmod->Boston	Boston->case->from	Boston->acl:relcl->Pizza	Pizza->nsubj->place	place->det->this	Pizza->cop->is	Pizza->case->like	Pizza->nmod:poss->Emma	Emma->case->'s	Pizza->nmod->Square	Square->case->in	Square->compound->Kendall	Square->nmod->Cambridge	Cambridge->case->in	Pizza->advcl->have	have->mark->although	have->nsubj->they	have->dobj->toppings	toppings->amod->more	toppings->compound->funky

I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food. The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed. Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great. DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.####mad->nsubj->I	mad->cop->'m	mad->advmod->still	mad->ccomp->had	had->mark->that	had->nsubj->i	had->xcomp->pay	pay->mark->to	pay->nmod->food	food->case->for	food->amod->lousy	rubber->nsubj->steak	steak->det->The	steak->compound->hanger	rubber->cop->was	rubber->case->like	rubber->cc->and	rubber->conj->flavorless	flavorless->nsubj->tuna	tuna->det->the	flavorless->cop->was	flavorless->dep->mention	mention->neg->not	mention->mark->to	mention->ccomp->tasted	tasted->nsubj->it	tasted->advcl->thawed	thawed->mark->like	thawed->nsubjpass->it	thawed->aux->had	thawed->advmod->just	thawed->auxpass->been	horrible->nsubj->Service	horrible->cop->was	horrible->advmod->also	horrible->cc->and	horrible->conj->great	great->nsubj->ambience	ambience->det->the	great->cop->is	great->neg->not	great->advmod->that	try->aux->DO	try->neg->not	try->advcl->going	going->mark->unless	going->nsubj->you	going->aux->'re	going->advmod->just	going->dobj->there	going->xcomp->hang	hang->mark->to	hang->compound:prt->out	hang->nmod->rest	rest->case->like	rest->det->the	rest->nmod->hipsters	hipsters->case->of	hipsters->det->the	hipsters->acl:relcl->have	have->nsubj->who	have->advmod->apparently	have->dobj->sense	sense->neg->no	sense->nmod->taste	taste->case->of
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try. This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent. The filet mignon dish was superb! I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices. It's a small cute restaurant.####go->nsubj->I	go->cc->and	go->conj->eat	eat->compound:prt->out	eat->nmod->restaurants	restaurants->case->at	restaurants->amod->many	restaurants->amod->different	go->cc->and	go->conj->place	place->nsubj->this	place->cop->is	place->nummod->one	place->acl:relcl->have	have->nsubj->you	have->ccomp->go	go->cc->and	go->conj->try	time->nsubj->This	time->cop->is	time->nmod:poss->my	time->amod->first	time->acl->writing	writing->dobj->review	review->det->a	review->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->for	restaurant->det->a	writing->advcl->excellent	excellent->mark->because	excellent->nsubj->food	food->det->the	food->cc->and	food->conj->service	excellent->cop->was	superb->nsubj->dish	dish->det->The	dish->amod->filet	dish->compound->mignon	superb->cop->was	come->nsubj->I	come->aux->would	come->advmod->defiantly	come->advmod->again	again->advmod->back	again->advmod->here	come->nmod->one	one->case->as	one->nmod->choices	choices->case->of	choices->nmod:poss->my	choices->amod->top	restaurant->nsubj->It	restaurant->cop->'s	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->amod->cute	cute->amod->small
I absolutely love this place!!! From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse. I like the ambience, it's very dark and original. I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since. The sushi is amazing!!!  And amazingly cheap.

Very affordable and excellent ambient! We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai. We were very disappointed. We won't go to this place again for a good meal. However, I think this place is a good hang out spot. Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.####affordable->advmod->Very	affordable->cc->and	affordable->conj->excellent	affordable->dep->ambient	ordered->nsubj->We	ordered->dobj->beef	beef->det->some	beef->cc->and	beef->conj->dishes	dishes->amod->noodle	dishes->compound->soup	ordered->nmod->section	section->case->from	section->det->the	section->compound->Thai	section->nmod->menu	menu->case->of	menu->det->the	ordered->cc->but	ordered->conj->Thai	Thai->nsubj->nothing	nothing->acl:relcl->got	got->nsubj->we	Thai->cop->was	disappointed->nsubj->We	disappointed->cop->were	disappointed->advmod->very	go->nsubj->We	go->aux->wo	go->neg->n't	go->nmod->place	place->case->to	place->det->this	go->nmod->meal	meal->advmod->again	meal->case->for	meal->det->a	meal->amod->good	think->advmod->However	think->nsubj->I	think->ccomp->hang	hang->nsubj->place	place->det->this	hang->cop->is	hang->det->a	hang->amod->good	hang->nmod->spot	spot->case->out	dare->advmod->Next	Next->dep->time	dare->nsubj->we	dare->aux->would	dare->neg->n't	dare->xcomp->ordering	ordering->dobj->anything	ordering->advmod->other	other->advmod->else	ordering->nmod->appetizers	appetizers->case->than	appetizers->det->some	appetizers->amod->simple	appetizers->amod->Asian	appetizers->cc->and	appetizers->conj->drinks
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time! THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area. It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country. They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it. Check this place out!

First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review. Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th. The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced. Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+. Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category. For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc....  Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service. To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.####romantic->nsubj->First	First->nmod->all	all->case->of	all->appos->place	place->det->this	romantic->cop->is	romantic->advmod->*not*	romantic->advcl->claimed	claimed->mark->as	claimed->nmod->review	review->case->by	review->nmod:poss->Citysearch	Citysearch->case->'s	review->compound->editorial	sharing->dep->Either	sharing->nsubj->that	that->cc->or	that->conj->idea	idea->nmod:poss->editor	editor->det->the	editor->case->'s	idea->nmod->romance	romance->case->of	sharing->aux->must	sharing->aux->be	sharing->dobj->conversation	conversation->det->a	sharing->nmod->table	table->case->with	table->det->the	table->amod->next	sharing->advcl->trying	trying->mark->while	trying->xcomp->speak	speak->mark->to	speak->advmod->louder	speak->nmod->traffic	traffic->case->than	traffic->det->the	traffic->nmod->57th	57th->case->on	close->nsubj->tables	tables->det->The	close->cop->are	close->advmod->crammed	crammed->dep->way	close->advmod->too	close->dep->typical	typical->nsubj->menu	menu->det->the	typical->cop->is	typical->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->of	restaurant->det->any	restaurant->amod->Italian	close->cc->and	close->conj->overpriced	overpriced->nsubj->list	list->det->the	list->compound->wine	overpriced->cop->is	overpriced->advmod->simply	start->nsubj->wines	wines->advmod->Slightly	wines->amod->above	wines->amod->average	start->nmod->70+	70+->case->at	70+->dep->$	70+->nmod->selection	selection->case->with	selection->advmod->only	selection->nummod->one	selection->acl->listed	listed->nmod->30+	30+->case->at	30+->dep->$	is->nsubj->Service	is->neg->not	is->ccomp->expect	expect->dobj->what	expect->nsubj->one	expect->aux->would	expect->nmod->joint	joint->case->from	joint->det->a	joint->nmod->category	category->case->in	category->det->this	category->compound->price	handed->nmod->instance	instance->case->For	handed->parataxis->dumped	dumped->nsubjpass->plates	dumped->auxpass->were	dumped->advmod->just	dumped->nmod->table	table->case->on	table->det->the	handed->nsubjpass->I	handed->auxpass->was	handed->dobj->list	list->det->the	list->compound->wine	handed->advmod->down	down->advmod->upside	handed->advmod->etc	constitute->csubj->working	working->advmod->Somehow	working->dobj->charm	charm->det->the	charm->amod->italian	working->nmod->grazie	grazie->case->with	grazie->amod->constant	grazie->compound->mille	constitute->aux->does	constitute->neg->not	constitute->dobj->service	service->amod->proper	food->advcl->fair	fair->mark->To	fair->cop->be	fair->advmod->completely	food->nsubj->factor	factor->det->the	factor->amod->only	factor->compound->redeeming	food->cop->was	food->det->the	food->acl:relcl->average	average->nsubj->which	average->cop->was	average->case->above	average->cc->but	average->conj->make	make->aux->could	make->neg->n't	make->compound:prt->up	make->nmod->deficiencies	deficiencies->case->for	deficiencies->det:predet->all	deficiencies->det->the	deficiencies->amod->other	deficiencies->nmod->Teodora	Teodora->case->of
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food. Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring. Fish was overdone. Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again. Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that. One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it. Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.####went->advcl->celebrate	celebrate->mark->To	celebrate->dobj->birthday	birthday->det->a	went->nsubj->three	three->nmod->us	us->case->of	went->xcomp->Mare	Mare->mark->to	Mare->xcomp->anticipating	anticipating->dobj->food	food->amod->great	edible->nsubj->one	one->neg->Not	one->nmod->meals	meals->case->of	meals->nmod:poss->our	edible->cop->was	edible->dep->bland	edible->cc->and/or	edible->conj->made	made->nmod->rosemary	rosemary->case->with	rosemary->amod->weird	rosemary->cc->or	rosemary->conj->flavoring	flavoring->compound->orange	overdone->nsubjpass->Fish	overdone->auxpass->was	go->nsubj->staff	staff->amod->Cute	staff->compound->place	staff->amod->nice	staff->compound->wait	go->advmod->but	go->aux->would	go->neg->never	go->advmod->there	go->advmod->again	left->ccomp->recommended	recommended->nsubj->Someone	Someone->advmod->else	recommended->dobj->dessert	dessert->det->the	left->nsubj->we	left->advmod->also	left->dobj->that	liked->nsubj->One	One->nmod->us	us->case->of	liked->advmod->actually	liked->dobj->expresso	expresso->det->the	expresso->acl:relcl->it	it->nsubj->that	it->cop->'s	disappointment->ccomp->Skip	Skip->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->this	disappointment->nsubj->it	disappointment->cop->'s	disappointment->det->a	disappointment->amod->big

I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away. It is simply amazing. The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious. I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try. You will find yourself returning quite often. P.S.

A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere. No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation. The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing! The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs. Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen. Beautiful experience.####serve->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->A	restaurant->acl:relcl->try	try->nsubj->that	try->aux->does	try->neg->n't	try->xcomp->do	do->mark->to	do->dobj->anything	do->nmod->except	serve->dobj->food	food->amod->great	serve->nmod->service	service->case->with	service->amod->great	service->nmod->atmosphere	atmosphere->case->in	atmosphere->det->a	atmosphere->amod->pleasant	gimmicks->neg->No	gimmicks->advmod->here	gimmicks->dep->food	food->det->the	food->acl:relcl->speaks	speaks->nmod->itself	itself->case->for	speaks->nmod->freshness	freshness->case->in	freshness->nmod:poss->its	freshness->cc->and	freshness->conj->preparation	elegant->nsubj->room	room->det->The	room->compound->dining	elegant->cop->is	elegant->advmod->quietly	elegant->nmod->music	music->case->with	music->neg->no	elegant->xcomp->shout	shout->mark->to	shout->compound:prt->over	elegant->parataxis->refreshing	refreshing->dep->how	impeccable->nsubj->service	service->det->The	impeccable->cop->was	impeccable->cc->and	impeccable->conj->unobtrusive	impeccable->parataxis->knows	knows->nsubj->staff	staff->det->the	knows->ccomp->are	are->dobj->what	are->nsubj->they	are->advmod->there	are->xcomp->do	do->mark->to	do->parataxis->know	know->mark->to	know->dobj->menu	menu->nmod:poss->their	know->conj->present	present->dobj->meal	meal->nmod:poss->your	know->cc->and	know->conj->attend	attend->nmod->needs	needs->case->to	needs->nmod:poss->your	saw->advcl->Looking	Looking->compound:prt->around	saw->nsubj->I	saw->dobj->room	room->det->a	room->nmod->Yorkers	Yorkers->case->full	Yorkers->case->of	Yorkers->compound->New	Yorkers->acl->enjoying	enjoying->dobj->meal	meal->det->a	meal->amod->real	meal->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->in	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->amod->real	room->appos->clubhouse	clubhouse->neg->not	clubhouse->det->a	clubhouse->nmod->fabulous	fabulous->case->of	fabulous->det->the	fabulous->acl->trying	trying->xcomp->seen	seen->mark->to	seen->auxpass->be	experience->amod->Beautiful
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull. The staff offers impeccable service. I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it. My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque. I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash. It was divine melts in your mouth. My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good . We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough.  We had Lava Cake... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it.  It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!!

The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines. The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion. People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.

With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great. The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees. We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat. The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse. Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable. No plans to return anytime soon.####great->nmod->exception	exception->case->With	exception->det->the	exception->nmod->salad	salad->case->of	salad->nmod:poss->our	salad->amod->lemon	salad->acl:relcl->pepper	pepper->nsubj->that	pepper->aux->had	pepper->advmod->much	much->advmod->so	pepper->nmod->it	it->case->on	pepper->ccomp->started	started->mark->that	started->nsubj->eyes	eyes->nmod:poss->our	started->dobj->watering	great->nsubj->food	food->det->the	great->advmod->here	great->cop->was	great->amod->decent	great->neg->not	think->ccomp->limited	limited->nsubj->menu	menu->det->The	limited->cop->is	limited->advmod->very	think->nsubj->i	think->ccomp->counted	counted->nsubj->we	counted->dobj->entrees	entrees->nummod->4	4->cc->or	4->conj->5	difficult->ccomp->ordered	ordered->nsubj->We	ordered->dobj->branzino	branzino->det->the	branzino->amod->special	branzino->amod->grilled	branzino->acl:relcl->infused	infused->nsubjpass->that	infused->auxpass->was	infused->advmod->so	infused->nmod->bone	bone->case->with	difficult->nsubj->it	difficult->cop->was	difficult->xcomp->eat	eat->mark->to	diner-ish->nsubj->decor	decor->det->The	decor->nmod->place	place->case->in	place->det->this	diner-ish->cop->is	diner-ish->advmod->very	diner-ish->cc->and	diner-ish->conj->expect	expect->nsubj->kind	kind->det->the	kind->nmod->place	place->case->of	expect->nsubj->you	expect->compound:prt->in	expect->dobj->Village	Village->det->the	Village->compound->East	Village->amod->romantic	romantic->neg->not	Village->amod->simple	simple->advmod->just	simple->conj->small	simple->cc->and	simple->conj->sparse	nothing->nsubj->Problem	nothing->cop->is	nothing->nmod->Prune	Prune->case->at	nothing->acl:relcl->memorable	memorable->cop->is	memorable->advmod->particularly	return->nsubj->plans	plans->neg->No	return->mark->to	return->advmod->soon	soon->advmod->anytime
This place is so much fun. Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant. This place must have cost the owners afortune to build. I think the stuff was better than Disney. Our food was great too! And really large portions. The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.

If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde. It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects. The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions. I highly recommend it.

The place is a lot of fun. My six year old loved it. The characters really make for an enjoyable experience. The food however, is what one might expect. It is very overpriced and not very tasty. However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.

Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels. Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY. The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size. They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great. The lox is always fresh too.

The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo. The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.

This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed! We weren't!

Molto bene! This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list. The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment. Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite. Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.

I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.

I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there. The food was authentic. I felt as though I were eating in Paris. The service was excellent - friendly and attentive. The prices are wonderfully low.

The food is good, I can't lie. But the staff was so horrible to us. The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out. We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order. This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price. Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!####lie->ccomp->good	good->nsubj->food	food->det->The	good->cop->is	lie->nsubj->I	lie->aux->ca	lie->neg->n't	horrible->cc->But	horrible->nsubj->staff	staff->det->the	horrible->cop->was	horrible->advmod->so	horrible->nmod->us	us->case->to	rude->nsubj->hostess	hostess->det->The	hostess->cc->and	hostess->conj->waitress	waitress->det->the	rude->cop->were	rude->advmod->incredibly	rude->cc->and	rude->conj->did	did->dobj->everything	did->dep->could	could->nsubj->they	could->xcomp->rush	rush->mark->to	rush->dobj->us	rush->compound:prt->out	planning->nsubj->We	planning->aux->were	planning->xcomp->get	get->mark->to	get->dobj->dessert	dessert->nmod->waitress	waitress->case->but	waitress->det->the	get->nmod->bill	bill->advmod->basically	bill->case->through	bill->det->the	bill->nmod->us	us->case->at	get->advcl->had	had->mark->before	had->nsubj->we	had->dobj->chance	chance->det->a	chance->nmod->order	order->case->to	pricey->nsubj->place	place->det->This	pricey->cop->is	pricey->cc->and	pricey->conj->worth	worth->discourse->yes	worth->nsubj->food	food->det->the	worth->cop->is	worth->dep->it	worth->cc->but	worth->conj->makes	makes->nsubj->service	service->det->the	makes->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->you	feel->advcl->paying	paying->mark->like	paying->nsubj->you	paying->aux->should	paying->aux->be	paying->dobj->quater	quater->det->a	quater->nmod->price	price->case->of	price->det->the	Save->iobj->yourself	Save->dobj->time	time->det->the	time->cc->and	time->conj->trouble	Save->cc->and	Save->conj->skip	skip->dobj->one	one->det->this
I'll keep this short. Amma is nothing special. The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place. I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.

Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections. Decor is nice though service can be spotty. This place is always packed. I know because I live nearby. Most importantly, food is excellent. Try the sea bass. Highly recommended.####selections->ccomp->dine	dine->aux->Do	dine->neg->n't	dine->nmod->Tamarind	Tamarind->case->at	Tamarind->nmod->dishes	dishes->case->for	dishes->det->the	dishes->compound->vegetarian	selections->nsubj->they	selections->cop->are	selections->advmod->simply	selections->advmod->up	up->dep->not	up->nmod->par	par->case->to	selections->case->with	selections->det->the	selections->amod->non-veg	nice->nsubj->Decor	nice->cop->is	nice->advcl->spotty	spotty->mark->though	spotty->nsubj->service	spotty->aux->can	spotty->cop->be	packed->nsubjpass->place	place->det->This	packed->auxpass->is	packed->advmod->always	know->nsubj->I	know->advcl->live	live->mark->because	live->nsubj->I	live->advmod->nearby	excellent->advmod->importantly	importantly->advmod->Most	excellent->nsubj->food	excellent->cop->is	Try->dobj->bass	bass->det->the	bass->compound->sea	recommended->nsubj->Highly
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks. As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by.  but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here. I am happy i did the food was awsome. JUST AWSOME. and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs. They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey. but overall i give it a 10 10####First->nmod->Rocks	Rocks->case->of	Rocks->det->all	Rocks->compound->Dal	Rocks->compound->Bukhara	go->csubj->need	need->mark->As	need->nsubj->student	student->det->a	student->nmod->i	i->case->in	i->compound->NYU	need->ccomp->i	i->nsubj->place	place->det->a	place->acl->eat	eat->mark->to	eat->nmod->day	day->case->after	day->det->a	day->amod->hard	day->nmod->work	work->case->of	i->advmod->so	i->advmod->usually	i->advmod->just	go->nmod->restraunt	restraunt->case->to	restraunt->det->any	restraunt->compound->indian	go->dep->by	by->case->near	heard->cc->but	heard->nsubj->ive	heard->dobj->lot	lot->det->a	heard->nmod->this	this->case->about	this->nmod->yrs	yrs->case->for	yrs->det->the	yrs->amod->past	yrs->nummod->2	heard->cc->and	heard->conj->decided	decided->advmod->finally	decided->xcomp->eat	eat->mark->to	eat->advmod->here	happy->nsubj->I	happy->cop->am	happy->ccomp->did	did->nsubj->i	did->ccomp->awsome	awsome->nsubj->food	food->det->the	awsome->cop->was	AWSOME->nsubj->JUST	is->cc->and	is->nsubj->Bukhara	Bukhara->advmod->yes	Bukhara->compound->Dal	is->advcl->kababs	kababs->mark->so	kababs->nsubj->dam	dam->amod->good	good->cc->and	good->advmod->so	kababs->cop->are	kababs->det:predet->all	kababs->det->the	opening->nsubj->They	opening->aux->are	opening->dobj->places	places->nummod->two	places->amod->more	opening->advcl->saw	saw->mark->as	saw->nsubj->i	saw->dobj->flyer	flyer->det->a	flyer->advmod->there	there->nmod:npmod->one	there->nmod->Yonkers	Yonkers->case->in	flyer->acl:relcl->hall	hall->nsubj->which	hall->cop->is	hall->det->a	hall->amod->restraunt	restraunt->cc->and	restraunt->conj->banquet	hall->cc->and	hall->conj->one	one->det->another	one->nmod->jersey	jersey->case->in	jersey->amod->parsipanny	jersey->amod->new	give->cc->but	give->nsubj->i	i->amod->overall	give->iobj->it	give->dobj->10	10->det->a

honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives. believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs. not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly. the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality. limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice.  the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish.  the waitstaffs are nice though. wont come back again for sure!####had->advmod->honestly	had->nsubj->sushi	sushi->det->the	sushi->amod->worst	sushi->dep->husband	husband->nmod:poss->my	sushi->cc->and	sushi->conj->i	had->nmod->lives	lives->case->in	lives->nmod:poss->our	lives->amod->entire	eating->ccomp->believe	believe->dobj->us	eating->nsubj->we	eating->aux->'ve	eating->aux->been	eating->dobj->sushi	eating->nmod->yrs	yrs->case->for	yrs->case->over	yrs->nummod->15	sure->neg->not	sure->dep->rated	rated->advmod->why	rated->nsubjpass->restaurant	restaurant->det->this	rated->aux->would	rated->auxpass->be	rated->xcomp->highly	highly->dep->that	quality->nsubj->sushi	sushi->det->the	sushi->amod->all-u-can-eat	quality->cop->is	quality->advmod->definitely	quality->case->in	quality->amod->poor	poor->advmod->very	menu->amod->limited	menu->appos->ingredients	ingredients->amod->no-so-fresh	menu->appos->fish	fish->amod->thinly-sliced	menu->appos->rice	rice->amod->fall-apart	sauce->dep->taste	taste->nsubj->u	u->det->the	u->amod->only	u->compound->things	taste->aux->could	taste->advmod->really	sauce->cop->are	sauce->det->the	sauce->amod->salty	salty->advmod->very	sauce->compound->soy	sauce->advmod->even	sauce->nsubj->sodium	sodium->nmod:poss->its	sodium->amod->low	sodium->conj->rice	rice->det->the	rice->amod->vinegar-soaked	sodium->cc->and	sodium->conj->scallion	scallion->det->the	scallion->nmod->top	top->case->on	top->nmod->fish	fish->case->of	fish->det->the	nice->nsubj->waitstaffs	waitstaffs->det->the	nice->cop->are	nice->advmod->though	wont->dep->come	come->advmod->again	again->advmod->back	come->advcl->sure	sure->case->for
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing. Once for dinner and once for brunch. Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude. They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another. Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you. The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again. I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.####Roth's->nsubj->I	Roth's->aux->have	Roth's->cop->been	Roth's->case->to	Roth's->advmod->twice	Roth's->cc->and	Roth's->conj->disappointing	disappointing->nsubj->times	times->det->both	disappointing->cop->were	disappointing->advmod->very	and->advmod->Once	Once->nmod->dinner	dinner->case->for	and->advmod->once	once->nmod->brunch	brunch->case->for	dissappointed->nsubj->times	times->det->Both	dissappointed->nsubj->I	dissappointed->cop->was	dissappointed->advmod->extremely	dissappointed->nmod->service	service->case->by	service->det->the	service->acl:relcl->rude	rude->nsubj->which	rude->cop->was	rude->amod->boarderline	let->nsubj->They	let->aux->would	let->neg->n't	let->advmod->even	let->ccomp->finish	finish->nsubj->me	finish->dobj->glass	glass->nmod:poss->my	glass->nmod->wine	wine->case->of	finish->advcl->offering	offering->mark->before	offering->dobj->another	seems->nsubj->Much	Much->nmod->time	time->case->of	time->det->the	time->dep->it	seems->advcl->care	care->mark->like	care->nsubj->they	care->aux->do	care->neg->not	care->nmod->you	you->case->about	ok->nsubj->dinner	dinner->det->The	ok->cop->was	ok->appos->nothing	nothing->acl:relcl->have	have->nsubj->I	have->aux->would	have->xcomp->again	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->benedict	benedict->nmod:poss->their	benedict->compound->eggs	benedict->nmod->brunch	brunch->case->for	brunch->acl:relcl->worst	worst->nsubj->which	worst->cop->were	worst->det->the	worst->nmod->life	life->case->in	life->nmod:poss->my	life->amod->entire	worst->dep->tried	tried->nsubj->I	tried->xcomp->removing	removing->dobj->sauce	sauce->det->the	sauce->amod->hollondaise	removing->advmod->completely	benedict->acl:relcl->was	was->nsubj->that	was->ccomp->was	was->advmod->failed	failed->advmod->how	was->nsubj->it

Planet Thai is great! We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere! The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must! Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap! Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT! Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait. It's popular w/the late crowd.####great->nsubj->Thai	Thai->compound->Planet	great->cop->is	love->nsubj->We	love->dobj->food	food->det->the	food->conj->drinks	food->cc->and	food->conj->atmosphere	rude->nsubj->svc	svc->det->The	rude->aux->can	rude->cop->be	rude->nmod:npmod->bit	bit->det->a	rude->nmod->times	times->case->at	times->appos->esp	rude->advcl->have	have->mark->if	have->nsubj->you	have->dobj->group	group->amod->big	rude->cc->but	rude->conj->a	a->advmod->overall	a->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->the	a->cop->is	a->dep->must	fabulous->ccomp->Try	Try->dobj->Thai	Thai->det->the	Thai->compound->Pad	fabulous->nsubj->it	fabulous->cop->'s	fabulous->cc->and	fabulous->conj->cheap	cheap->nsubj->prices	prices->nmod:poss->their	cheap->cop->are	cheap->advmod->so	GREAT->advcl->cheap	cheap->advmod->Just	cheap->mark->because	cheap->nsubj->it	cheap->cop->'s	cheap->ccomp->does	does->ccomp->mean	mean->nsubj->NOT	mean->dep->small	small->nsubj->portions	portions->det->the	small->cop->are	small->cc->or	small->conj->nasty	nasty->nsubj->food	food->det->the	nasty->cop->is	GREAT->nsubj->IT	GREAT->cop->IS	have->advcl->go	go->advmod->Just	go->ccomp->remember	go->dep->later	later->det->the	go->nsubj->you	have->dep->longer	longer->det->the	have->nsubj->you	have->aux->may	have->xcomp->wait	wait->mark->to	crowd->nsubj->It	crowd->cop->'s	crowd->amod->w/the	w/the->amod->popular	crowd->amod->late
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter. Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.

I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it. Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city. They have authentic Indian at amazin prices. This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever. The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.

Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood. The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent. The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great. The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing. The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices. Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high. The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.####restaurant->nsubj->Inn	Inn->compound->Mermaid	restaurant->cop->is	restaurant->det->an	restaurant->amod->overall	restaurant->amod->good	restaurant->nmod->seafood	seafood->case->with	seafood->amod->good	good->advmod->really	limited->nsubj->menu	menu->det->The	limited->cop->is	limited->cc->but	limited->conj->excellent	excellent->nsubj->all	all->advmod->almost	all->nmod->dishes	dishes->case->of	dishes->det->the	excellent->cop->are	good->nsubj->sandwich	sandwich->det->The	sandwich->compound->lobster	good->cop->is	good->cc->and	good->conj->great	great->nsubj->spaghetti	spaghetti->det->the	spaghetti->nmod->Scallops	Scallops->case->with	Scallops->cc->and	Scallops->conj->Shrimp	great->cop->is	good->nsubj->service	service->det->The	service->acl:relcl->good	good->cop->is	good->cc->and	good->conj->ambience	good->cop->is	good->nmod->outing	outing->case->for	outing->det->a	outing->compound->date	date->cc->or	date->conj->group	prices->nsubj->fallback	fallback->det->The	fallback->amod->only	fallback->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->on	restaurant->det->this	prices->cop->is	prices->det->the	high->nmod->seafood	seafood->advmod->Even	seafood->case->though	seafood->nmod:poss->its	seafood->amod->good	high->nsubj->prices	prices->det->the	high->cop->are	high->advmod->too	24->nsubj->sandwich	sandwich->det->The	sandwich->compound->lobster	24->cop->is	24->dep->$	24->cc->and	24->conj->good	good->mark->although	good->nsubj->it	good->cop->was	good->ccomp->enough	enough->nsubj->it	enough->cop->was	enough->neg->not	enough->advmod->nearly	enough->xcomp->warrant	warrant->mark->to	warrant->dobj->price	price->det->that
Went to Village last night for my birthday. We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch. When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort. Truly the mark of an attentive waiter. I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.####Went->nmod->Village	Village->case->to	Went->nmod:tmod->night	night->amod->last	Went->nmod->birthday	birthday->case->for	birthday->nmod:poss->my	picked->nsubj->We	picked->dobj->it	picked->advmod->randomly	picked->nmod->recommendation	recommendation->case->without	recommendation->det->a	recommendation->nmod->someone	someone->case->from	recommendation->acl:relcl->been	been->nsubj->who	been->aux->has	been->advmod->there	picked->dep->so	picked->parataxis->sure	sure->nsubj->we	sure->cop->were	sure->neg->n't	sure->ccomp->expect	expect->nsubj->what	expect->mark->to	surprised->nsubj->We	surprised->cop->were	surprised->advmod->very	surprised->advmod->pleasantly	delicious->nsubj->food	food->det->The	delicious->cop->was	delicious->ccomp->had	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->special	special->det->a	special->amod->halibut	delicious->dep->had	had->nsubj->husband	husband->nmod:poss->my	had->dobj->steak	delicious->cc->and	delicious->conj->top-notch	top-notch->nsubj->service	service->det->the	top-notch->cop->was	was->advcl->came	came->advmod->When	came->nsubj->dessert	dessert->nmod:poss->my	was->expl->there	was->nsubj->candle	candle->det->a	candle->nmod->it	it->case->in	was->advcl->asked	asked->dep->not	asked->mark->because	asked->nsubj->anyone	asked->nmod->one	one->case->for	asked->cc->but	asked->conj->seen	seen->mark->because	seen->nsubj->waiter	waiter->det->the	seen->aux->must	seen->aux->have	seen->dep->opening	opening->nsubj->me	opening->dobj->card	card->nmod:poss->my	card->compound->birthday	card->cc->and	card->conj->gift	seen->cc->and	seen->conj->said	said->ccomp->knew	knew->nsubj->he	knew->ccomp->occassion	occassion->nsubj->it	occassion->cop->was	occassion->det->a	occassion->amod->special	occassion->nmod->sort	sort->case->of	sort->det->some	Truly->dobj->mark	mark->det->the	mark->nmod->waiter	waiter->case->of	waiter->det->an	waiter->amod->attentive	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->the	recommend->advcl->experience	experience->case->based	experience->case->on	experience->nmod:poss->our	experience->nmod:tmod->night	night->amod->last
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods. We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods. Why? They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money. please don't fool us.####ate->nsubj->We	ate->nmod->place	place->case->at	place->det->this	place->compound->Thai	place->nmod->reviews	reviews->case->following	reviews->det->the	ate->cc->but	ate->conj->unhappy	unhappy->advmod->very	unhappy->nmod->foods	foods->case->with	foods->det->the	thought->nsubj->We	thought->ccomp->using	using->mark->that	using->nsubj->place	place->det->this	using->aux->is	using->advmod->much	much->advmod->too	using->nmod->cooking	cooking->case->of	cooking->compound->MSG	cooking->nmod->foods	foods->case->in	foods->det->the	concern->nsubj->They	concern->aux->do	concern->neg->n't	concern->dobj->much	much->nmod->health	health->case->of	health->nmod:poss->customer	customer->case->'s	health->dep->want	want->advmod->just	want->xcomp->make	make->mark->to	make->dobj->money	please->ccomp->fool	fool->aux->do	fool->neg->n't	fool->dobj->us
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke. I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab. The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice. Of course, it is crowded but who cares. Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.####visit->nsubj->I	visit->dobj->Bo	Bo->compound->New	Bo->compound->Green	Bo->dep->have	have->advmod->when	have->nsubj->I	have->dobj->money	have->cc->or	have->conj->broke	broke->advmod->when	broke->nsubj->I	broke->cop->am	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->dobj->fish	fish->det->the	fish->amod->jelly	fish->conj->chicken	chicken->compound->drunken	fish->cc->and	fish->conj->crab	crab->det->the	crab->amod->dumplings	dumplings->advmod->soupy	crab->amod->blue	blue->nmod:npmod->fry	fry->advmod->certainly	fry->det->the	fry->amod->stir	cheap->nsubj->food	food->det->The	cheap->cop->is	cheap->advmod->so	cheap->cc->and	cheap->conj->nice	nice->nsubj->waiters	waiters->det->the	nice->cop->are	crowded->nmod->course	course->case->Of	crowded->nsubjpass->it	crowded->auxpass->is	crowded->dep->cares	cares->cc->but	cares->nsubj->who	recommend->nsubj->style	style->compound->Authentic	style->compound->Shanghai	style->cc->and	style->conj->I	recommend->aux->can	recommend->neg->not	recommend->dobj->place	place->det->a	place->amod->better	place->compound->Shanghai	place->nmod->York	York->case->in	York->compound->New
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent. Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10. The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating. (The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!) Wine list is extensive without being over-priced. Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials. Definitely a neighborhood favorite.####remains->nsubj->ino	ino->amod->Have	ino->amod->frequented	ino->nmod->years	years->case->for	years->amod->several	years->cc->and	years->conj->food	food->det->the	remains->xcomp->excellent	delight->nsubj->plate	plate->amod->Cheese	delight->cop->is	delight->det->a	delight->amod->varied	delight->cc->and	delight->conj->bargain	bargain->amod->great	delight->nmod->10	10->case->at	10->dep->$	tramezzinis->nsubj->selection	selection->det->The	selection->amod->large	selection->nmod->bruschettas	bruschettas->case->of	bruschettas->appos->paninis	tramezzinis->xcomp->keep	keep->dobj->palate	palate->det->the	keep->advcl->stagnating	stagnating->mark->from	winner->nsubj->bruschetta	bruschetta->det->The	bruschetta->amod->asparagus,	bruschetta->amod->truffle	bruschetta->amod->oil,	bruschetta->compound->parmesan	winner->cop->is	winner->det->a	extensive->nsubj->list	list->compound->Wine	extensive->cop->is	extensive->advcl->over-priced	over-priced->mark->without	over-priced->cop->being	sure->cop->Be	sure->xcomp->try	try->mark->to	try->dobj->specials	specials->det->the	specials->amod->seasonal	seasonal->cc->and	seasonal->conj->delicious	delicious->advmod->always	favorite->dep->Definitely	favorite->det->a	favorite->compound->neighborhood
I loved this place!! I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded. The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great. The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.####loved->nsubj->I	loved->dep->place	place->det->this	hesititate->nsubj->I	hesititate->advmod->almost	hesititate->xcomp->write	write->mark->to	write->dobj->review	review->det->a	write->advcl->great	great->mark->because	great->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->the	great->cop->was	great->advmod->so	great->cc->and	great->conj->hate	hate->nsubj->I	hate->aux->would	hate->advcl->become	become->mark->for	become->nsubj->it	become->advmod->too	become->advcl->crowded	crowded->case->to	great->ccomp->good	good->nsubj->food	food->det->The	good->cop->was	good->advmod->very	great->nsubj->deal	deal->det->a	deal->amod->great	deal->cc->and	deal->conj->place	place->det->the	place->dep->self	self->nmod:poss->its	great->cop->was	freindly->nsubj->staff	staff->det->The	staff->compound->wait	freindly->cop->is	freindly->advmod->very	freindly->ccomp->make	make->nsubj->they	make->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->it	feel->advcl->eating	eating->mark->like	eating->nsubj->you	eating->aux->'re	eating->nmod->town	town->case->in	town->det->a	town->amod->freindly	town->amod->little	town->compound->european
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!! The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served. The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing. After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on. We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager. The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.####jsut->ccomp->like	like->nsubj->I	like->ccomp->get	get->nsubj->Noir	Noir->compound->Cafe	get->aux->do	get->neg->n't	get->xcomp->wrong	wrong->nsubj->me	jsut->nsubj->it	jsut->cop->is	jsut->dep->people	people->mark->that	people->det->the	people->acl:relcl->work	work->nsubj->who	work->ccomp->are	are->expl->there	are->xcomp->evil	evil->cc->and	evil->conj->incompetent	had->ccomp->terrible	terrible->nsubj->service	service->det->The	terrible->cop->was	had->nsubj->we	had->xcomp->wait	wait->mark->to	wait->nmod->everything	everything->case->for	wait->cc->and	wait->conj->ask	ask->dobj->several	several->nmod->people	people->case->of	people->amod->different	ask->nmod->thing	thing->case->for	thing->det->the	thing->amod->same	had->advcl->allowed	allowed->mark->before	allowed->nsubjpass->we	allowed->auxpass->were	allowed->xcomp->served	served->mark->to	served->auxpass->be	seems->nsubj->waitress	waitress->det->The	seems->xcomp->concerned	concerned->mark->to	concerned->auxpass->be	concerned->advmod->more	concerned->advcl->looking	looking->mark->of	looking->dobj->waitress	waitress->amod->good	good->advcl->actually	actually->case->than	grabbed->nmod->dinner	dinner->case->After	grabbed->nsubj->manager	manager->det->the	grabbed->dobj->boyfriend	boyfriend->nmod:poss->my	grabbed->dep->asked	asked->dobj->him	grabbed->advcl->are	are->advmod->Where	are->ccomp->frommaybe	frommaybe->nsubj->you	frommaybe->ccomp->know	know->nsubj->you	know->aux->do	know->neg->n't	know->ccomp->work	work->advmod->how	work->nsubj->things	work->nmod->Americaand	Americaand->case->in	work->nmod->stormed	stormed->case->in	stormed->det->the	stormed->compound->end	stormed->acl->teareyed	teareyed->advmod->almost	almost->advmod->away	teareyed->xcomp->yelling	yelling->ccomp->thing	thing->mark->that	thing->nsubj->tips	thing->cop->are	thing->det->the	thing->amod->only	thing->acl:relcl->survive	survive->nsubj->they	survive->compound:prt->on	guess->ccomp->did	did->nsubj->We	did->dobj->tip	guess->nsubj->I	guess->ccomp->wanted	wanted->nsubj->model/ASPECT0	model/ASPECT0->det->the	wanted->advmod->just	wanted->dobj->more	wanted->cc->and	wanted->conj->complained	complained->nmod->manager	manager->case->to	manager->det->the	unprofessional->nsubj->set	set->det->The	set->amod->whole	unprofessional->advmod->up	unprofessional->cop->is	unprofessional->advmod->truly	unprofessional->cc->and	unprofessional->conj->wish	wish->nsubj->I	wish->ccomp->get	get->nsubj->Noir	Noir->compound->Cafe	get->aux->would	get->dobj->staff	staff->det->some	staff->amod->good	wish->advcl->place	place->mark->because	place->nmod->one	one->case->despite	one->det->the	one->amod->current	place->nsubj->this	place->cop->is	place->det->a	place->amod->great
Pizza here is consistently good. Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal. You should pass on the calamari. It is thick and slightly soggy. Decor is charming.

What a great place. I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband. The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty. I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place. I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!####What->nmod->place	place->dep->a	place->amod->great	came->nsubj->I	came->nmod->city	city->case->into	city->det->the	came->xcomp->try	try->mark->to	try->compound:prt->out	try->dobj->restaurant	restaurant->det->this	try->advcl->recommended	recommended->mark->because	recommended->nsubj->friend	friend->det->a	recommended->aux->had	recommended->dobj->it	recommended->nmod->husband	husband->case->to	husband->nmod:poss->my	fun->nsubj->ambience	ambience->det->The	fun->cop->was	fun->advmod->so	fun->cc->and	fun->conj->great	great->nsubj->prices	prices->det->the	great->cop->were	great->nmod->top	top->case->on	top->nmod->fact	fact->case->of	fact->det->the	fact->dep->tasty	tasty->mark->that	tasty->nsubj->food	food->det->the	tasty->cop->was	tasty->advmod->really	thrilled->nsubjpass->I	thrilled->auxpass->was	thrilled->neg->n't	thrilled->xcomp->have	have->mark->to	have->xcomp->wait	wait->mark->to	wait->nmod->line	line->case->on	line->nmod->minutes	minutes->case->for	minutes->nummod->thirty	thrilled->cc->but	thrilled->conj->guess	guess->nsubj->I	guess->ccomp->price	price->mark->that	price->cop->'s	price->det->the	price->acl:relcl->pay	pay->nsubj->you	pay->nmod->place	place->case->for	place->det->a	place->amod->popular	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->aux->would	recommend->advmod->definitely	recommend->dobj->SEA	recommend->advcl->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->you	like->dobj->cuisine	cuisine->amod->thai
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever. A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order. When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently  While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude. The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.

I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there. The food is great and reasonably priced. I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name. If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table. The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.####Casimir->nsubj->I	Casimir->aux->have	Casimir->cop->been	Casimir->case->to	Casimir->nmod->times	times->case->over	times->compound->5	Casimir->cc->and	Casimir->conj->had	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->have	had->advmod->always	had->dobj->time	time->det->a	time->amod->great	had->advmod->there	great->nsubjpass->food	food->det->The	great->auxpass->is	great->cc->and	great->conj->priced	priced->advmod->reasonably	tried->nsubj->I	tried->aux->have	tried->xcomp->make	make->mark->to	make->dobj->reservations	tried->cc->but	tried->conj->have	have->nsubj->times	times->det->both	have->nsubj->hostess	hostess->det->the	have->aux->did	have->neg->n't	have->dobj->name	name->nmod:poss->my	try->advcl->nice	nice->mark->If	nice->nsubj->weather	weather->det->the	nice->cop->is	try->xcomp->snag	snag->mark->to	snag->dobj->table	table->det->an	table->amod->outside	nice->nsubj->staff	staff->det->The	nice->aux->has	nice->cop->been	nice->cc->but	nice->conj->seemed	seemed->nsubj->they	seemed->xcomp->stressed	stressed->advmod->really	nice->cc->and	nice->conj->needs	needs->nsubj->bathroom	bathroom->det->the	bathroom->compound->unisex	needs->xcomp->cleaned	cleaned->mark->to	cleaned->auxpass->be	cleaned->advmod->often	often->advmod->more
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent. From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it. Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed. I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.####went->nsubj->boyfriend	boyfriend->nmod:poss->My	boyfriend->cc->and	boyfriend->conj->I	went->dobj->there	went->xcomp->celebrate	celebrate->mark->to	celebrate->dobj->birthday	birthday->nmod:poss->my	celebrate->nmod:tmod->night	night->det->the	night->amod->other	went->cc->and	went->advmod->all	went->ccomp->say	say->nsubj->I	say->aux->can	say->ccomp->is	is->ccomp->magnificent	magnificent->mark->that	magnificent->nsubj->it	magnificent->cop->was	felt->nmod->caviar	caviar->case->From	caviar->det->the	caviar->amod->spectacular	caviar->nmod->waitstaff	waitstaff->case->to	waitstaff->det->the	waitstaff->amod->hospitable	felt->nsubj->I	felt->nmod->royalty	royalty->case->like	felt->cc->and	felt->conj->enjoyed	enjoyed->dobj->second	second->det->every	second->nmod->it	it->case->of	rush->advcl->patrons	patrons->mark->Considering	patrons->nsubj->we	patrons->cop->were	patrons->det->the	patrons->amod->last	patrons->advmod->there	patrons->cc->and	patrons->conj->time	time->nsubj->it	time->cop->was	time->case->after	time->det->the	time->amod->closing	rush->nsubj->waitstaff	waitstaff->det->the	rush->aux->did	rush->neg->not	rush->dobj->us	rush->nmod->all	all->case->at	rush->cc->and	rush->conj->made	made->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->us	feel->xcomp->comfortable	feel->cc->and	feel->conj->relaxed	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->advmod->highly	recommend->dobj->Russe	Russe->compound->Caviar	Russe->nmod->anyone	anyone->case->to	Russe->acl:relcl->wants	wants->nsubj->who	wants->dobj->service	service->amod->delicious	service->amod->top	service->compound->grade	service->amod->caviar	caviar->cc->and	caviar->conj->fantastic
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant. Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order. I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.

My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend. I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had. I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world. My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good. We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there. Overall, excellent restaurant!####vacation->nsubj->friends	friends->nmod:poss->My	friends->cc->and	friends->conj->I	vacation->cop->were	vacation->case->on	vacation->nmod->NY	NY->case->in	vacation->cc->and	vacation->conj->referred	referred->auxpass->was	referred->nmod->Chance	Chance->case->to	referred->nmod->friend	friend->case->by	friend->det->a	found->nsubj->I	found->dobj->food	food->det->the	found->advcl->outstanding	outstanding->mark->to	outstanding->cop->be	outstanding->advmod->particulary	found->dobj->dish	dish->det->the	dish->compound->salmon	dish->acl:relcl->had	had->nsubj->I	ordered->nsubj->I	ordered->advmod->also	ordered->dobj->Mojito	Mojito->det->the	Mojito->compound->Change	Mojito->acl:relcl->world	world->nsubj->which	world->cop->was	world->advmod->out	world->case->of	world->det->this	settled->nsubj->friends	friends->nmod:poss->My	settled->nmod->dishes	dishes->case->for	dishes->compound->rice	settled->cc->but	settled->conj->came	came->nsubj->we	came->compound:prt->back	came->nmod:tmod->day	day->det->the	day->amod->following	day->acl->try	try->mark->to	try->dobj->sum	sum->det->the	sum->compound->dim	sum->acl:relcl->outstanding	outstanding->nsubj->which	outstanding->cop->was	outstanding->amod->goodnot	outstanding->cc->but	outstanding->conj->good	ate->nsubj->We	ate->compound:prt->out	ate->nmod->patio	patio->case->in	patio->det->the	patio->amod->back	patio->acl:relcl->worth	worth->nsubj->which	worth->cop->is	worth->dep->it	worth->advcl->cool	cool->mark->as	cool->nsubj->it	cool->cop->'s	ate->cc->and	ate->conj->hear	hear->nsubj->music	music->det->the	hear->aux->is	hear->advmod->there	there->advmod->well	Overall->appos->restaurant	restaurant->amod->excellent

I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries. I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food. My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge! But, they were too big for the bun. Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them. Also they were $15 each! I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll. It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!####got->nsubj->I	got->dobj->piece	piece->det->an	piece->amod->excellent	piece->nmod->cheesecake	cheesecake->case->of	got->cc->and	got->conj->had	had->nsubj->we	had->dobj->pastries	pastries->amod->several	pastries->amod->other	pastries->amod->nice	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->aux->would	recommend->dobj->Roxy	Roxy->case->'s	recommend->nmod->that	that->case->for	that->cc->but	that->conj->food	food->neg->not	food->case->for	food->nmod:poss->their	wanted->nsubj->son	son->nmod:poss->My	son->cc->and	son->conj->girlfriend	girlfriend->nmod:poss->his	wanted->dep->both	wanted->ccomp->huge	huge->nsubj->cheeseburgers	cheeseburgers->cc->and	cheeseburgers->conj->they	huge->cop->were	big->cc->But	big->nsubj->they	big->cop->were	big->advmod->too	big->nmod->bun	bun->case->for	bun->det->the	fell->advmod->Consequently	fell->nsubj->burgers	burgers->nmod:poss->their	fell->compound:prt->apart	fell->nmod->hands	hands->case->in	hands->nmod:poss->their	fell->cc->and	fell->conj->made	made->dobj->mess	mess->det:predet->such	mess->det->a	made->ccomp->did'nt	did'nt->mark->that	did'nt->nsubj->they	did'nt->xcomp->feel	feel->advcl->finishing	finishing->mark->like	finishing->dobj->them	15->advmod->Also	15->nsubj->they	15->cop->were	15->dep->$	15->dep->each	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->sandwich	sandwich->det->a	sandwich->amod->huge	sandwich->compound->pastrami	sandwich->nmod->roll	roll->case->on	roll->det->a	bad->nsubj->It	bad->cop->was	bad->neg->not	not->nmod:npmod->14	14->dep->$	bad->advmod->really	bad->nmod->pound	pound->case->for	pound->det->a	pound->nmod->Pastrami-but	Pastrami-but->case->of	Pastrami-but->acl:relcl->have	have->nsubj->it	have->aux->did	have->neg->n't	have->dobj->taste-I	taste-I->amod->much	taste-I->acl:relcl->had	had->aux->'ve	had->dobj->better	had->advcl->elsewhere	elsewhere->case->for	elsewhere->advmod->less
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food. The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish. And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic. If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.####trendi->nsubj->place	place->det->This	trendi->cop->is	trendi->advmod->really	trendi->cc->but	trendi->conj->forgotten	forgotten->nsubj->they	forgotten->aux->have	forgotten->nmod->part	part->case->about	part->det->the	part->amod->important	important->advmod->most	part->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->of	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->appos->food	food->det->the	soo->nsubjpass->times	times->det->The	times->amod->last	times->nummod->two	times->acl:relcl->ordered	ordered->nsubj->I	ordered->nmod->food	food->case->from	food->advmod->here	food->nmod:poss->my	soo->auxpass->was	soo->advmod->spicy	soo->ccomp->eat	eat->mark->that	eat->nsubj->I	eat->aux->could	eat->advmod->barely	eat->dobj->it	soo->cc->and	soo->conj->took	took->nsubj->spice	spice->det->the	took->compound:prt->away	took->nmod->flavor	flavor->case->from	flavor->det->the	flavor->nmod->dish	dish->case->of	dish->det->the	pathetic->cc->And	pathetic->nsubj->soup	soup->det->the	soup->compound->Tom	soup->compound->Kha	pathetic->cop->was	want->mark->If	want->nsubj->you	want->dobj->Thai	Thai->amod->good	Thai->amod->authentic	Thai->acl:relcl->place	place->nsubj->place	place->det->this	place->cop->is	place->neg->not	place->det->the	place->acl->go	go->mark->to
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food. The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before. Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave. THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden. I will definetly be going back.####went->nsubj->We	went->advmod->here	went->nmod->lunch	lunch->case->for	went->nmod->Saturday	Saturday->advmod->ago	ago->nmod:npmod->couple	couple->det->a	couple->nmod->weeks	weeks->case->of	Saturday->case->on	Saturday->det->a	went->cc->and	went->conj->impressed	impressed->nsubjpass->I	impressed->auxpass->was	impressed->advmod->thoroughly	impressed->nmod->food	food->case->with	food->det->the	pizza->nsubj->pizza	pizza->det->The	pizza->compound->pesto	pizza->cop->was	pizza->amod->excellent	pizza->amod->thin-crust	pizza->nmod->amount	amount->case->with	amount->det->a	amount->amod->nice	amount->nmod->cheese	cheese->case->of	cheese->amod->spicy	cheese->amod->Italian	pizza->ccomp->heard	heard->mark->that	heard->nsubj->I	heard->aux->'d	heard->neg->never	heard->advcl->before	before->case->of	located->nsubj->Conveniently	located->advmod->too	located->xcomp->right	right->cop->being	right->nmod->ave	ave->case->on	ave->compound->Bedford	pleasant->nsubj->area	area->nummod->THe	area->amod->back	area->compound->garden	area->amod->sitting	pleasant->cop->is	pleasant->advmod->very	pleasant->advcl->see	see->advmod->where	see->nsubj->you	see->aux->can	see->dobj->garden	garden->nmod:poss->their	garden->amod->personal	garden->compound->herb	going->nsubj->I	going->aux->will	going->advmod->definetly	going->aux->be	going->advmod->back
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC. My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had. We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful. I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one. We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right. We will be back.####had->nsubj->We	had->dobj->sandwich	sandwich->det->the	sandwich->compound->lobster	had->cc->and	had->conj->FANTASTIC	FANTASTIC->nsubj->it	FANTASTIC->cop->was	fine->ccomp->said	said->nsubj->husband	husband->nmod:poss->My	said->ccomp->eaten	eaten->nsubj->he	eaten->aux->could	eaten->aux->'ve	eaten->dobj->more	more->amod->several	fine->nsubj->portion	portion->det->the	fine->cop->was	fine->nmod->me	me->case->for	me->acl:relcl->exclaimed	exclaimed->nsubj->he	exclaimed->advmod->even	exclaimed->ccomp->best	best->mark->that	best->nsubj->fries	fries->det->the	fries->amod->french	best->cop->were	best->det->the	best->acl:relcl->had	had->nsubj->he	had->aux->has	had->nsubj->We	had->dobj->scallops	scallops->det->the	scallops->nmod->appetizer	appetizer->case->as	appetizer->det->an	had->cc->and	had->conj->delicious	delicious->nsubj->they	delicious->cop->were	delicious->cc->and	delicious->conj->wonderful	wonderful->nsubj->sauce	sauce->det->the	wonderful->cop->was	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->xcomp->getting	getting->dobj->reservation	reservation->det->a	getting->advcl->saw	saw->advmod->even	saw->mark->though	saw->nsubj->we	saw->dobj->people	people->acl->seated	seated->nmod->one	one->case->without	waited->nsubj->We	waited->nmod->bar	bar->case->at	bar->det->the	waited->cc->and	waited->conj->had	had->dobj->martinis	martinis->acl:relcl->right	right->nsubj->that	right->cop->were	right->advmod->just	be->nsubj->We	be->aux->will	be->advmod->back

I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all. Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting. The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had). I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.####has->dep->lived	lived->nsubj->I	lived->aux->'ve	lived->nmod->NY	NY->case->in	lived->nmod->years	years->case->for	years->nummod->5	years->cc->and	years->conj->place	place->det->this	has->dobj->it	has->nsubj->all	food->amod->Great	food->appos->menu	menu->amod->good	menu->compound->size	menu->conj->service	service->amod->great	menu->cc->and	menu->conj->setting	setting->det->an	setting->amod->unpretensious	offered->nsubj->dishes	dishes->det->The	offered->ccomp->tasty	tasty->cop->were	tasty->dep->unique	tasty->advmod->very	tasty->cc->and	tasty->conj->fresh	tasty->nmod->sausages	sausages->case->from	sausages->det->the	sausages->amod->lamb	sausages->appos->sardines	sardines->nmod->biscuits	biscuits->case->with	biscuits->appos->shrimp	shrimp->amod->large	shrimp->amod->whole	shrimp->nmod->cream	cream->case->to	cream->det->the	cream->amod->amazing	cream->compound->pistachio	cream->compound->ice	cream->dep->best	best->det->the	cream->cc->and	cream->conj->freshest	freshest->acl:relcl->had	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->'ve	had->advmod->ever	glad->nsubj->I	glad->cop->'m	glad->ccomp->introduced	introduced->nsubjpass->I	introduced->auxpass->was	introduced->nmod->place	place->case->to	place->det->this	introduced->cc->and	introduced->conj->gem	gem->nsubj->this	gem->cop->is	gem->det->a	gem->amod->rare	gem->nmod->NY	NY->case->in

The service was excellent and the food was delicious. We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.

Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery. I've waited over one hour for food. They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice. A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner? The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.####Average->nmod->food	food->case->to	food->amod->good	food->compound->Thai	Average->nmod->delivery	delivery->case->but	delivery->amod->terrible	waited->nsubj->I	waited->aux->'ve	waited->nmod->hour	hour->case->over	hour->nummod->one	hour->nmod->food	food->case->for	abrupt->nsubj->They	abrupt->cop->were	abrupt->advmod->very	abrupt->nmod->me	me->case->with	abrupt->advcl->called	called->advmod->when	called->nsubj->I	called->cc->and	called->conj->claimed	claimed->advmod->actually	claimed->ccomp->late	late->nsubj->food	food->det->the	late->cop->was	late->advcl->rice	rice->mark->because	rice->nsubj->they	rice->cop->were	rice->advmod->out	rice->case->of	restaurant->det->A	restaurant->compound->Thai	restaurant->nmod->rice	rice->advmod->out	rice->case->of	restaurant->nmod->dinner	dinner->case->during	arrived->nsubj->food	food->det->The	arrived->dobj->minutes	minutes->nummod->20	arrived->advcl->called	called->mark->after	called->nsubj->I	called->advmod->cold	cold->cc->and	cold->conj->soggy

Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night. We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial. She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food. We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry. The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates. We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter. I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.####Went->nmod->Spice	Spice->case->to	Spice->compound->Cafe	Spice->nmod->4	4->case->with	4->nmod->friends	friends->case->of	friends->nmod:poss->my	Went->nmod->night	night->case->on	night->det->a	night->compound->saturday	greeted->nsubjpass->We	greeted->auxpass->were	greeted->advmod->promptly	greeted->nmod->waiter	waiter->case->by	waiter->det->the	waiter->acl:relcl->nice	nice->nsubj->who	nice->cop->was	nice->advmod->very	nice->cc->and	nice->conj->cordial	helpful->nsubj->She	helpful->cop->was	helpful->advmod->very	helpful->advcl->suggesting	suggesting->mark->in	suggesting->ccomp->drinks	drinks->nsubj->us	drinks->cc->and	drinks->conj->helped	helped->dobj->us	helped->advcl->ordering	ordering->mark->in	ordering->dobj->lot	lot->det->a	lot->nmod->dishes	dishes->case->of	dishes->amod->good	helpful->advcl->knew	knew->mark->since	knew->nsubj->we	knew->dobj->nothing	knew->nmod->food	food->case->about	food->amod->Indian	fast->nsubj->We	fast->cop->were	fast->xcomp->order	order->mark->to	order->dobj->platter	platter->det->the	platter->compound->appetizer	order->advcl->hungry	hungry->mark->since	hungry->nsubj->we	hungry->cop->were	hungry->advmod->very	looked->nsubj->food	food->det->The	looked->xcomp->appetizing	appetizing->advmod->very	appetizing->cc->and	appetizing->conj->delicious	appetizing->ccomp->came	came->mark->since	came->nsubj->it	came->nmod->variety	variety->case->on	variety->det->a	variety->nmod->plates	plates->case->of	plates->amod->fancy	ended->nsubj->We	ended->dobj->experience	experience->nmod:poss->our	experience->amod->great	ended->advcl->having	having->mark->by	having->ccomp->recommended	recommended->nsubj->-LRB-dessert-RRB-	-LRB-dessert-RRB-->compound->Gulab	-LRB-dessert-RRB-->compound->Jamun	recommended->nmod->waiter	waiter->case->by	waiter->det->the	thanked->nsubj->I	thanked->dobj->friend	friend->nmod:poss->my	friend->acl:relcl->recommended	recommended->nsubj->who	recommended->xcomp->restaurant	restaurant->nsubj->me	restaurant->det->this	recommended->cc->and	recommended->conj->recommend	recommend->aux->will	recommend->advmod->certainly	recommend->dobj->it	recommend->nmod->others	others->case->to
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table. Service here was great, food was fantastic. Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared. Will absolutely visit again.

You cannot go wrong with this place. The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional. Always a nice crowd, but never loud. Go here.

I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded. However, it is jus too good to not praise it. By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.

We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly. The menu has so many fish items and oysters. We all ordered different entrees so we could share. The fish was really,really fresh.

The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back. Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here. There are other people waiting! We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total. As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry. Our friends have not arrived yet. So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary! For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!####mediocre->nsubj->food	food->det->The	mediocre->cop->was	mediocre->advcl->best	best->case->at	mediocre->cc->but	mediocre->conj->service	service->nsubj->it	service->cop->was	service->det->the	service->amod->horrible	service->acl:relcl->made	made->nsubj->that	made->ccomp->vow	vow->nsubj->me	vow->neg->never	vow->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->advmod->back	took->advcl->paid	paid->advmod->Immediately	paid->mark->after	paid->nsubj->we	took->nsubj->waiter	waiter->det->the	took->dobj->money	money->det->the	took->cc->and	took->conj->said	took->parataxis->okay	took->parataxis->outta	outta->nsubj->guys	guys->dep->you	outta->cop->are	outta->advmod->here	are->expl->There	are->nsubj->people	people->amod->other	people->acl->waiting	total->nsubj->We	total->aux->were	total->neg->n't	total->advmod->even	even->nmod->table	table->case->at	table->nmod:poss->our	table->nmod->hour	hour->case->for	hour->advmod->more	more->mwe->than	hour->advmod->an	hurry->ccomp->said	said->advcl->leaving	leaving->mark->As	leaving->nsubj->we	leaving->aux->were	said->nsubj->couple	couple->det->the	couple->acl->standing	standing->nmod->door	door->case->by	door->det->the	said->nmod->waiter	waiter->case->to	waiter->det->another	hurry->nsubj->we	hurry->cop->'re	hurry->neg->not	hurry->case->in	hurry->det->a	arrived->nsubj->friends	friends->nmod:poss->Our	arrived->aux->have	arrived->neg->not	arrived->advmod->yet	unnecessary->advmod->So	unnecessary->csubj->rushing	rushing->dobj->us	rushing->compound:prt->out	unnecessary->cop->was	unnecessary->advmod->absolutely	place->nmod->people	people->case->For	people->det->the	people->acl:relcl->want	want->nsubj->who	want->dobj->food	food->amod->great	food->nmod->service	service->case->plus	service->amod->great	place->nsubj->Roxy	place->cop->is	place->det->a	place->nmod->AVOID	AVOID->case->to

delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere. Kind, attentive wait staff. I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).

This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice. Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK. They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone. The counter service is bad. They charge different prices all the time. They're rude at times, and not very friendly.

Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary. The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these. The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced. Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.####complimentary->nsubj->Anybody	Anybody->acl:relcl->likes	likes->nsubj->who	likes->ccomp->planet	planet->nsubj->place	place->det->this	planet->aux->must	planet->cop->be	planet->case->from	planet->det->a	planet->amod->different	planet->advcl->greasy	greasy->advmod->where	greasy->conj->dry	greasy->cc->and	greasy->conj->tasteless	complimentary->cop->are	skimpy->nsubj->dosas	dosas->det->The	skimpy->cop->are	skimpy->conj->unattractive	skimpy->cc->and	skimpy->conj->drip	skimpy->nmod->grease	grease->case->with	skimpy->cc->and	skimpy->conj->drink	drink->advmod->personally	drink->nsubj->I	drink->aux->'d	drink->dobj->popcorn	drink->xcomp->topping	topping->advcl->eat	eat->mark->before	eat->nsubj->I	eat->aux->'d	eat->dobj->one	one->det->another	one->nmod->these	these->case->of	dry->nsubj->sandwiches	sandwiches->det->The	dry->cop->are	dry->conj->tasteless	dry->cc->and	dry->conj->overpriced	overpriced->nmod:npmod->way	Calling->dobj->place	place->det->the	place->acl:relcl->warn	warn->nsubj->Co	Co->compound->Hampton	Co->compound->Chutney	warn->aux->does	warn->dobj->you	warn->ccomp->offer	offer->mark->that	offer->nsubj->folks	folks->det->these	offer->dobj->style	style->amod->more	offer->nmod->substance	substance->case->than	offer->cc->but	offer->conj->was	was->nmod->room	room->case->in	room->det->this	room->amod->unattractive	room->nmod->clerks	clerks->case->with	clerks->amod->unhelpful	was->expl->there	was->nsubj->dearth	dearth->det->a	dearth->nmod->former	former->case->of	former->det->the	was->advmod->too

This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside. The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty. It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise. The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.

The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered. The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water. The sushi was awful! The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard. Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting. The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced. It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.####encountered->nsubj->excuse	excuse->det->The	excuse->amod->worst	excuse->nmod->I	I->case->for	I->amod->Japanese	I->compound->food	encountered->aux->'ve	encountered->advmod->ever	sauce->nsubj->soup	soup->det->The	soup->nmod->udon	udon->case->for	udon->det->the	sauce->cop->was	sauce->compound->soy	sauce->cc->and	sauce->conj->water	awful->nsubj->sushi	sushi->det->The	awful->cop->was	quality->nsubjpass->rice	rice->det->The	quality->auxpass->was	quality->dep->poor	quality->cc->and	quality->conj->cooked	cooked->auxpass->was	cooked->advmod->badly	badly->advmod->so	badly->dep->hard	hard->nsubj->it	hard->cop->was	had->advmod->Furthermore	had->nsubj->rice	rice->det->the	had->dobj->seasoning	seasoning->neg->no	had->advcl->bland	bland->mark->so	bland->nsubj->sushi	sushi->det->the	bland->cop->was	bland->cc->and	bland->conj->disgusting	adequate->nsubj->fish	fish->det->The	adequate->cop->was	adequate->cc->but	adequate->conj->sliced	sliced->advmod->inexpertly	obvious->nsubj->It	obvious->cop->is	obvious->ccomp->has	has->mark->that	has->nsubj->one	one->neg->no	one->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->in	restaurant->det->the	has->dobj->idea	idea->det->any	idea->advmod->about	idea->cc->or	idea->conj->experience	experience->nmod->cuisine	cuisine->case->with	cuisine->amod->Japanese

I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date. The place was quiet and delightful. Service was good and food is wonderful.

As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city. The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way). The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries. But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs. You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music. The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests. You can't go wrong with this place.####say->nmod->hipster	hipster->case->As	hipster->det->a	hipster->amod->retired	say->nsubj->I	say->aux->can	say->nmod->degree	degree->case->with	degree->det->some	degree->nmod->certainty	certainty->case->of	say->ccomp->night	night->mark->that	night->nmod->year	year->case->for	year->det->the	year->amod->last	night->nsubj->Strike	Strike->compound->Lucky	night->aux->has	night->cop->been	night->det->the	night->amod->best	night->amod->laid-back	night->amod->late	night->nmod->city	city->case->in	city->det->the	pleasant->nsubj->staff	staff->det->The	staff->compound->wait	pleasant->cop->is	pleasant->appos->fun	pleasant->cc->and	pleasant->conj->part	part->case->for	part->det->the	part->amod->most	pleasant->dep->way	way->amod->gorgeous	gorgeous->nmod->beautification	beautification->case->in	beautification->det->the	beautification->amod->wonderful	beautification->amod->aesthetic	way->advmod->not	not->nmod->#	#->case->in	#->det->that	#->amod->she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b	#->nummod->@	#->advmod->way	way->nmod:npmod->*	*->dep->$	yummy->nsubj->food	food->det->The	yummy->cop->is	yummy->advmod->especially	yummy->dep->mussels	mussels->nmod:poss->their	mussels->amod->cooked-to-perfection	mussels->nmod->sauce	sauce->case->in	sauce->amod->spicy	sauce->compound->tomato	sauce->cc->and	sauce->conj->fries	fries->nmod:poss->their	fries->compound->shoestring	fries->compound->crispy	night->cc->But	night->nsubj->part	part->det->the	part->amod->best	part->nmod->LS	LS->case->about	night->cop->is	night->det->the	night->amod->late	night->dep->atmosphere	night->amod->free	free->advmod->delightfully	night->nmod->BTs	BTs->case->of	BTs->det->the	get->nsubj->You	get->aux->can	get->dobj->martini	martini->det->a	martini->amod->delish	delish->advmod->completely	get->nmod->glass	glass->case->in	glass->det->a	glass->acl:relcl->drinks	drinks->nsubj->that	drinks->cop->'s	drinks->nummod->1/2	1/2->advmod->about	1/2->compound->2	drinks->nmod->850	850->case->for	850->dep->$	850->acl:relcl->recommend	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->dobj->Shanty	Shanty->det->the	Shanty->compound->Vanilla	Shanty->appos->mmmm	mmmm->nmod->homey	homey->case->in	homey->det->a	homey->amod->great	homey->acl->setting	setting->nmod->music	music->case->with	music->amod->great	has->nsubj->DJ	DJ->det->The	DJ->amod->in-house	DJ->compound->lady	DJ->nmod->nights	nights->case->on	nights->compound->Saturday	has->dobj->taste	taste->amod->good	good->advmod->outrageously	taste->nmod->music	music->case->in	has->cc->and	has->advmod->moreover	has->conj->takes	takes->dobj->requests	go->nsubj->You	go->aux->ca	go->neg->n't	go->xcomp->wrong	go->nmod->place	place->case->with	place->det->this
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too. Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again. I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST! I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced. I will go back to Suan soon!

Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say. They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying. The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it. Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table. The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative. A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards. These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner: (1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard (2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.####get->aux->Do	get->neg->not	get->dobj->Hamburgers	Hamburgers->det->the	Hamburgers->compound->Go	Hamburgers->compound->Go	Hamburgers->appos->matter	matter->neg->no	matter->acl:relcl->say	say->dobj->what	say->nsubj->reviews	reviews->det->the	895->nsubj->They	895->cop->were	895->case->such	895->det->a	895->amod->rip-off	895->dep->$	895->case->for	895->dep->patties	patties->nummod->four	patties->amod->small	patties->compound->meat	patties->nmod->buns	buns->case->in	buns->amod->steamed	895->cc->and	895->conj->not	895->dep->worth	worth->dep->trying	worth->nsubj->rest	rest->det->The	rest->nmod->sum	sum->case->of	sum->det->the	sum->compound->dim	worth->dep->pricey	pricey->mark->though	pricey->nmod->standards	standards->case->by	standards->amod->Chinatown	worth->cop->is	worth->dep->it	brought->nsubj->fresh	fresh->compound->Steamed	brought->advmod->so	brought->dobj->hot	hot->amod->hot	hot->amod->hot	brought->nmod->table	table->case->to	table->nmod:poss->your	sum->nsubj->wait	wait->det->The	sum->advmod->here	sum->cop->is	sum->advmod->long	sum->case->for	sum->compound->dim	sum->cc->but	sum->conj->sleek	sleek->advcl->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->you	like->aux->do	like->neg->n't	like->dobj->tables	tables->compound->sharing	like->cc->or	like->conj->gig	gig->mark->if	gig->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->the	atmosphere->amod->typical	atmosphere->amod->raucous	atmosphere->compound->dim	atmosphere->compound->sum	gig->cop->is	gig->neg->not	gig->nmod:poss->your	sleek->nsubj->this	sleek->cop->is	sleek->det->a	sleek->nmod->alternative	alternative->case->for	alternative->compound->Chinatown	skip->nsubj->tips	tips->det->A	tips->amod->few	skip->dobj->cake	cake->det->the	cake->compound->turnip	cake->conj->buns	buns->compound->roast	buns->compound->pork	cake->cc->and	cake->conj->custards	custards->compound->egg	overpriced->nsubj->These	overpriced->cop->are	overpriced->cc->and	overpriced->conj->get	get->nsubj->you	get->aux->can	get->advmod->just	just->advmod->better	get->nmod->corner	corner->case->around	corner->det->the	cakes->nsubj->turnip	turnip->nummod->1	cakes->nmod->kiosk	kiosk->case->at	kiosk->det->the	kiosk->amod->little	kiosk->nmod->side	side->case->on	side->amod->east	side->nmod->St	St->case->of	St->compound->Mott	St->nmod->bayard	bayard->advmod->south	south->advmod->just	bayard->case->of	custards->nummod->2	custards->compound->egg	custards->cc->and	custards->conj->buns	buns->compound->pork	custards->nmod->bakery	bakery->case->at	bakery->det->either	bakery->nmod->side	side->case->on	side->amod->west	side->nmod->street	street->case->of	street->compound->Mott	custards->dep->south	south->advmod->just	south->nmod->Canal	Canal->case->of
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner. I was pleasantly suprised. The food was exceptional. The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc. I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual. The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal####decided->advcl->passing	passing->mark->After	passing->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->by	restaurant->det->this	restaurant->nmod->sometime	sometime->case->for	decided->nsubj->I	decided->advmod->finally	decided->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->compound:prt->in	go->cc->and	go->conj->have	have->dobj->dinner	suprised->nsubj->I	suprised->cop->was	suprised->advmod->pleasantly	exceptional->nsubj->food	food->det->The	exceptional->cop->was	places->nsubj->menu	menu->det->The	menu->acl->consisted	consisted->nmod->food	food->case->of	food->amod->standard	food->compound->brassiere	consisted->advmod->better	places->advmod->then	places->nmod->etc	etc->case->like	etc->compound->Balthazar	shank->ccomp->choose	choose->nsubj->I	choose->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->nmod->one	one->case->with	one->nmod->special	special->case->of	special->det->the	shank->nsubj->lamb	lamb->det->the	lamb->amod->braised	shank->nmod->wine	wine->case->in	wine->amod->red	wine->acl:relcl->excellent	excellent->nsubj->which	excellent->cop->was	friendly->nsubj->service	service->det->The	friendly->cop->was	friendly->cc->and	friendly->conj->casual	casual->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->the	casual->cop->was	noisy->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->The	noisy->cop->is	noisy->nmod:npmod->bit	bit->det->a	noisy->ccomp->something	something->cc->but	something->nsubj->that	something->cop->is	something->acl:relcl->overlooked	overlooked->nsubjpass->that	overlooked->aux->can	overlooked->auxpass->be	overlooked->advcl->sit	sit->mark->once	sit->nsubj->you	sit->compound:prt->down	overlooked->cc->and	overlooked->conj->enjoy	enjoy->dobj->great	great->det->a

This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service. The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it. They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile! Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything. Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.####served->nsubjpass->place	place->det->This	served->aux->would	served->auxpass->be	served->advmod->better	better->advmod->so	better->advmod->much	served->advcl->run	run->mark->by	run->auxpass->being	run->nmod->group	group->case->by	group->det->a	group->acl:relcl->understands	understands->nsubj->that	understands->advmod->actually	understands->dobj->service	service->compound->customer	walk->nsubj->thing	thing->det->The	thing->amod->only	thing->acl:relcl->do	do->nsubj->you	do->aux->can	do->advmod->here	walk->aux->is	walk->nmod->in	walk->cc->and	walk->conj->eat	walk->cc->but	walk->conj->planning	planning->ccomp->forget	forget->nsubj->event	event->det->an	event->advmod->especially	event->dep->one	one->det->a	one->amod->small	one->amod->intimate	forget->nmod->it	it->case->about	helpful->nsubj->They	helpful->cop->are	helpful->neg->not	helpful->nmod->least	least->case->in	least->det->the	helpful->cc->and	helpful->conj->give	give->aux->will	give->iobj->you	give->dobj->run	run->det->the	run->amod->grand	run->advmod->so	so->advmod->around	so->nmod->time	time->case->by	time->det->the	run->acl:relcl->rolls	rolls->nsubj->date	date->det->the	date->compound->event	rolls->compound:prt->around	rolls->ccomp->regret	regret->nsubj->you	regret->aux->will	regret->neg->not	regret->advmod->only	regret->xcomp->chosing	chosing->dobj->place	place->det->this	regret->cc->but	regret->conj->become	become->advmod->also	become->xcomp->hostile	give->nsubj->Nobody	Nobody->nmod->restaurant	restaurant->case->at	restaurant->det->this	give->aux->will	give->dobj->answers	answers->compound->firm	give->nmod->anything	anything->case->about	anything->cc->and	anything->conj->end	end->case->in	end->det->the	give->parataxis->takes	takes->neg->not	takes->nsubj->person	person->nummod->one	takes->dobj->responsibility	responsibility->nmod->anything	anything->case->for	deserves->nsubj->Terrible	Terrible->appos->management	management->amod->terrible	deserves->xcomp->shut-down	shut-down->mark->to	shut-down->cop->be
Never fails to please. delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven. Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey. Service is fast and friendly. Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.

Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal. The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying. If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype. Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.####'s->advmod->Been	's->expl->there	's->advcl->done	done->dobj->that	that->cc->and	that->conj->York	York->compound->New	's->nsubj->it	's->neg->not	's->iobj->big	big->det->that	big->dep->deal	deal->det->a	decent->nsubj->food	food->det->The	decent->cop->is	decent->advcl->best	best->case->at	decent->cc->and	decent->conj->matter	matter->nsubj->ambience	ambience->det->the	matter->advmod->well	matter->nsubj->it	matter->cop->'s	matter->det->a	matter->nmod->opinion	opinion->case->of	decent->conj->consider	consider->nsubj->some	consider->aux->may	consider->dobj->it	consider->xcomp->thing	thing->mark->to	thing->cop->be	thing->det->a	thing->amod->sweet	decent->conj->thought	thought->nsubj->I	thought->ccomp->annoying	annoying->nsubj->it	annoying->cop->was	annoying->advmod->just	yawn->advcl->make	make->mark->If	make->nsubj->celebrities	make->advcl->sweat	sweat->nsubj->you	sweat->dep->your	your->advmod->then	your->nmod->ride	ride->case->in	ride->case->for	ride->det->a	sweat->cc->but	sweat->conj->like	like->mark->if	like->nsubj->your	like->advmod->most	like->nmod->parts	parts->case->around	parts->det->these	like->advmod->then	yawn->nsubj->you	yawn->aux->'ll	yawn->advmod->just	yawn->cc->and	yawn->conj->wonder	yawn->dobj->whats	yawn->nmod->hype	hype->case->with	hype->det:predet->all	hype->det->the	restaurant->nsubj->Rao	restaurant->cop->is	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->amod->good	restaurant->cc->but	restaurant->conj->nothing	nothing->nmod:poss->it	it->case->'s	nothing->amod->special

I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience. Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience. Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion. Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.####love->nsubj->I	love->dobj->Ess-a-bagel	love->cc->but	love->conj->live	live->nsubj->I	live->nmod->side	side->case->on	side->det->the	side->amod->west	live->advcl->go	go->mark->so	go->nsubj->I	go->advmod->often	go->nmod->Murray	Murray->case->to	Murray->case->'s	Murray->nmod->convenience	convenience->case->for	fine->nsubj->bagels	bagels->nmod:poss->Their	fine->cop->are	fine->cc->but	fine->conj->overcooked	overcooked->nsubj->they	overcooked->cop->are	overcooked->nmod:npmod->little	little->det->a	overcooked->cc->and	overcooked->conj->experience	experience->neg->not	experience->advmod->really	experience->det->a	experience->amod->special	experience->amod->bagel	Better->nmod->shop	shop->case->than	shop->det->the	shop->amod->bagel	Better->nmod->corner	corner->case->on	corner->det->the	corner->cc->but	corner->conj->going	going->neg->not	going->mark->worth	going->compound:prt->out	going->nmod->way	way->case->of	way->nmod:poss->your	way->case->for	Better->nmod->opinion	opinion->case->in	opinion->nmod:poss->my	Also->xcomp->expensive	expensive->dep->little	little->det->a	expensive->advmod->more	expensive->nmod->place	place->case->than	place->nmod:poss->your	place->amod->average	place->amod->bagel

Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly. The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine. The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains. The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal. Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...####treated->nsubjpass->virgins	virgins->amod->Volare	virgins->cc->or	virgins->conj->regulars	regulars->amod->weekly	regulars->appos->everyone	treated->auxpass->gets	treated->dobj->same	same->det->the	treated->cc->and	treated->conj->ask	ask->nsubj->you	ask->aux->ca	ask->neg->n't	ask->nmod->more	more->case->for	more->nmod->that	that->case->than	ask->ccomp->friendly	friendly->advmod->when	friendly->nsubj->service	service->det->the	friendly->cop->is	friendly->det->this	has->nsubj->restaurant	restaurant->det->The	has->dobj->feel	feel->det->a	feel->compound->Family	has->advcl->least	least->neg->not	least->nmod->regard	regard->case->with	regard->nmod->portions	portions->case->to	portions->det->the	portions->acl:relcl->enormous	enormous->nsubj->which	enormous->cop->are	has->parataxis->solved	solved->nsubj->veal	veal->det->the	solved->advmod->alone	solved->aux->could	solved->aux->have	solved->advmod->single-handedly	solved->dobj->famine	famine->amod->third	famine->compound->world	excellent->nsubj->anti-pasta	anti-pasta->det->The	excellent->cop->was	excellent->nmod->calamari	calamari->advmod->especially	calamari->det->the	calamari->dep->mains	mains->mark->as	mains->cop->were	mains->det->the	mains->compound->filling	mains->compound->pasta	extensive->nsubj->list	list->det->The	list->compound->wine	extensive->cop->is	extensive->cc->and	extensive->conj->hike	hike->aux->can	hike->advmod->easily	hike->compound:prt->up	hike->dobj->meal	meal->det->an	meal->amod->otherwise	meal->amod->priced	priced->advmod->reasonably	off-set->advmod->Still	off-set->nsubj->quibbles	quibbles->det->any	quibbles->nmod->bill	bill->case->about	bill->det->the	off-set->cop->were	off-set->nmod->measures	measures->case->by	measures->det->the	measures->amod->pour-your-own	measures->nmod->liquers	liquers->case->of	liquers->acl:relcl->house	house->nsubj->which	house->cop->were	house->advmod->courtesey	house->case->of	house->det->the

This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks! (Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!! Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!) Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while. I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED! All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends! Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...####spot->nsubj->This	spot->cop->is	spot->det->the	spot->amod->perfect	spot->nmod->friends	friends->case->for	friends->compound->meeting	spot->acl->having	having->dobj->drinks	drinks->amod->lunch	lunch->conj->dinner	lunch->conj->pre-theatre	lunch->cc->or	lunch->conj->after-theatre	ask->nsubj->Always	ask->dobj->bartender	bartender->det->the	bartender->nmod->SEASONAL	SEASONAL->case->for	SEASONAL->det->the	ask->dep->beer	Guaranteed->xcomp->experience	experience->mark->to	experience->cop->be	experience->det->a	experience->amod->tasty	get->nsubj->spot	spot->amod->Excellent	spot->nmod->holiday	holiday->case->for	get->dobj->togethers	get->nmod->co-workers	co-workers->case->with	co-workers->cc->or	co-workers->conj->friends	get->ccomp->seen	seen->mark->that	seen->nsubj->you	seen->aux->have	seen->neg->n't	seen->nmod->while	while->case->in	while->det->a	doing->nsubj->I	doing->aux->have	doing->aux->been	doing->dobj->all	all->nmod->Brewery	Brewery->case->of	Brewery->det->the	Brewery->amod->above	above->nmod->Heartland	Heartland->case->at	Heartland->det->the	Brewery->nmod->years	years->case->for	years->amod->over	years->nummod->5	doing->advmod->now	doing->cc->and	doing->conj->HAVE	HAVE->nsubj->I	HAVE->ccomp->DISAPPOINTED	DISAPPOINTED->nsubj->BEEN	BEEN->compound->NEVER	people->det:predet->All	people->det->the	people->dep->bring	bring->mark->that	bring->nsubj->I	bring->ccomp->go	go->expl->there	go->compound:prt->back	go->nmod->own	own->case->on	own->nmod:poss->their	go->cc->and	go->conj->bring	go->nsubj->friends	friends->amod->THEIR	Go->xcomp->go	go->expl->there	go->dep->yesyou	yesyou->advmod->once	once->cc->and	once->conj->oh	go->aux->will	go->dobj->will	will->amod->backyou

Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best. The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful. It is expensive but well worth the money.

Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most. Service was very prompt but slightly rushed. Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.

My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian. Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage. The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle. A real dissapointment. But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had. They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies. Priced at upper intermediate range.####surprised->nsubj->friend	friend->nmod:poss->My	friend->nmod->Milan	Milan->case->from	Milan->cc->and	Milan->conj->myself	surprised->cop->were	surprised->advmod->pleasantly	surprised->advcl->arrived	arrived->advmod->when	arrived->nsubj->we	arrived->cc->and	arrived->conj->spoke	spoke->nsubj->everyone	spoke->dobj->italian	heritage->nsubj->food	food->amod->bad	bad->advmod->Too	food->det->the	heritage->cop->was	heritage->neg->n't	heritage->case->of	heritage->det->the	heritage->amod->same	tasteless->nsubj->special	special->det->The	special->amod->porcini	special->compound->mushroom	special->compound->pasta	tasteless->cop->was	tasteless->advcl->tagliatelle	tagliatelle->mark->so	tagliatelle->cop->was	tagliatelle->det->the	tagliatelle->compound->seafood	dissapointment->det->A	dissapointment->amod->real	icing->cc->But	icing->nsubj->that	icing->cop->was	icing->neg->n't	icing->det->the	icing->nmod->cake	cake->case->on	cake->det->the	cake->appos->tiramisu	tiramisu->det->a	tiramisu->acl:relcl->resembled	resembled->nsubj->that	resembled->xcomp->nothing	nothing->acl:relcl->had	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->have	had->advmod->ever	called->nsubj->They	called->aux->should	called->aux->have	called->xcomp->mascarpone	mascarpone->nsubj->it	mascarpone->nmod->chocolate	chocolate->case->with	chocolate->amod->chips-good	chocolate->amod->but	chocolate->dep->cry	cry->det->a	cry->amod->far	called->advcl->implies	implies->mark->from	implies->dobj->what	implies->nsubj->name	name->det->the	Priced->nmod->range	range->case->at	range->amod->upper	range->amod->intermediate

This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city. I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge). It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend. It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone. However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place. Quick and friendly service. This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.

When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's. When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside. The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly. I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.

After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try. We were less than impressed. While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better. We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.

Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca). Was surprisingly disappointed. Pizza was a little soggy.

The food was actually aweful. I'm not picky - but it was actually gross. The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting. Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.

This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples. The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes. The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.

Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent. The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people. Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money. Can't wait to go back.####last->nsubj->Went	last->advmod->here	last->dobj->service	service->compound->night	service->amod->nice	service->compound->decor	service->amod->good	last->cc->but	last->conj->excellent	excellent->nsubj->food	food->det->the	excellent->cop->was	excellent->advmod->surprisingly	HUGE->nsubj->portions	portions->det->The	HUGE->cop->are	HUGE->dep->so	HUGE->parataxis->good	good->nsubj->it	good->aux->might	good->cop->be	good->xcomp->order	order->mark->to	order->dobj->things	things->nummod->three	order->xcomp->split	split->mark->to	split->dobj->appetizer	appetizer->cc->rather	rather->mwe->than	appetizer->nummod->one	appetizer->cc->and	appetizer->conj->person	person->compound->entree	person->compound->per	person->nmod->people	people->case->for	people->nummod->two	offers->nmod->all	all->case->Among	all->nmod->restaurants	restaurants->case->of	restaurants->det->the	restaurants->amod->new	restaurants->amod->5th	restaurants->compound->avenue	offers->nsubj->this	offers->nmod->one	one->case->by	one->advmod->far	one->nmod->values	values->case->of	values->det->the	values->amod->best	values->nmod->money	money->case->for	money->nmod:poss->your	wait->aux->Ca	wait->neg->n't	wait->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->advmod->back

My roommate and I LOVE this place. We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me. Indoor was very cozy and cute. The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good. While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.

I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend. The decor is very simple but comfortable. The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach. The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that. You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.

Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity. The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...). I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork. This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it. Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread. Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices... Service is not what you are coming here for... Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...

Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants. If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place. Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit. Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.

This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret! Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!####Queens->nsubj->place	place->det->This	place->acl:relcl->old	old->nsubj->which	old->cop->is	old->nmod:npmod->months	months->nummod->few	few->advmod->only	few->advmod->a	Queens->cop->is	Queens->advmod->perhaps	Queens->amod->secret	secret->dep->biggest	make->nsubj->decor	decor->compound->Fabulous	make->ccomp->makes	makes->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->you	feel->advcl->restaurant	restaurant->mark->like	restaurant->nsubj->you	restaurant->cop->'re	restaurant->case->in	restaurant->det->a	restaurant->amod->trendy	restaurant->compound->Manhattan	restaurant->appos->food	food->amod->good	good->advmod->very	good->advmod->very	food->appos->staff	staff->amod->cheaply-priced	staff->amod->friendly	friendly->advmod->generally	restaurant->cc->and	restaurant->conj->Manhattanite	Manhattanite->mark->if	Manhattanite->nsubj->you	Manhattanite->cop->'re	Manhattanite->det->a	feel->cc->or	feel->conj->spend	feel->dobj->most	most->nmod->time	time->case->of	time->nmod:poss->your	feel->nmod->Manhattan	Manhattan->case->in	make->nsubj->Avenue	Avenue->compound->Rice	make->aux->will	make->ccomp->feel	feel->nsubj->you	feel->nmod->Side	Side->case->at	Side->amod->homevery	Side->compound->Soho/Village/Upper	Side->compound->West	Side->nmod->prices	prices->case->minus	prices->det->the	prices->amod->expensive	prices->cc->and	prices->conj->clienteleall	clienteleall->compound->pretentious	prices->nmod->Avenue	Avenue->case->on	Avenue->compound->Roosevelt
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date. We were then shooed inside. One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so. We left, never to return. With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.####seated->nsubjpass->We	seated->auxpass->were	seated->advmod->outside	seated->cc->and	seated->conj->spilled	spilled->nsubj->waiter	waiter->det->the	spilled->dobj->wine	wine->amod->red	wine->cc->and	wine->conj->tea	tea->amod->hot	spilled->nmod->myself	myself->case->on	myself->cc->and	myself->conj->date	date->nmod:poss->my	shooed->nsubjpass->We	shooed->auxpass->were	shooed->advmod->then	shooed->advmod->inside	think->nsubj->One	think->aux->would	think->xcomp->get	get->nsubj->we	get->aux->'d	get->dobj->drinks	drinks->det->an	drinks->compound->apology	apology->cc->or	apology->conj->complimentary	get->parataxis->got	got->advmod->instead	got->nsubj->we	got->ccomp->take	take->nsubj->waiter	waiter->det->a	waiter->amod->snobby	take->aux->would	take->neg->n't	take->advmod->even	take->dobj->order	order->nmod:poss->our	take->nmod->minutes	minutes->case->for	minutes->nummod->15	take->cc->and	take->conj->gave	gave->iobj->us	gave->dobj->lip	think->advcl->asked	asked->advmod->when	asked->nsubj->we	asked->dobj->him	asked->xcomp->do	do->mark->to	do->advmod->so	left->nsubj->We	left->xcomp->return	return->neg->never	return->mark->to	need->nmod->restaurants	restaurants->case->With	restaurants->amod->many	many->advmod->so	restaurants->amod->good	restaurants->nmod->UWS	UWS->case->on	UWS->det->the	need->nsubj->I	need->aux->do	need->neg->n't	need->dobj->food	food->amod->overpriced	food->conj->wait-staff	wait-staff->amod->arrogant	arrogant->advmod->absurdly	wait-staff->ccomp->recognize	recognize->nsubj->who	recognize->aux->do	recognize->neg->n't	recognize->ccomp->work	work->nsubj->they	work->nmod->diner	diner->case->at	diner->det->a	diner->amod->glorified	food->conj->service	service->amod->clumsy	food->cc->and	food->conj->management	management->acl:relcl->care	care->nsubj->that	care->aux->does	care->neg->n't
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side. If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave. Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.####new->nsubj->I	new->cop->am	new->advmod->relatively	new->nmod->area	area->case->to	area->det->the	new->cc->and	new->conj->tried	new->dep->Pick	Pick->dobj->bgel	bgel->det->a	Pick->nmod->2nd	2nd->case->on	new->cc->and	new->conj->disappointed	disappointed->auxpass->was	disappointed->nmod->service	service->case->with	service->det->the	new->cc->and	new->conj->thought	thought->nsubj->I	thought->ccomp->overated	overated->nsubj->food	food->det->the	overated->cop->was	overated->cc->and	overated->conj->side	side->case->on	side->det->the	side->amod->pricey	try->csubj->area	area->mark->If	area->nsubj->you	area->cop->are	area->case->in	area->det->the	try->dobj->Shoppe	Shoppe->det->The	Shoppe->compound->Bagel	Shoppe->nmod->street	street->case->on	street->amod->74th	Shoppe->acl:relcl->Ave	Ave->nsubj->which	Ave->cop->is	Ave->advmod->away	away->nmod:npmod->blocks	blocks->nummod->3	Ave->case->on	Ave->amod->2nd	bagels->amod->Great	bagels->conj->spreads	bagels->cc->and	bagels->conj->place	place->det->a	place->amod->good	bagels->dep->hang	hang->case->to	hang->compound:prt->out	hang->nmod->in
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town. However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town. The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.

Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices. The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent. He offers subpar service and has no personality. In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment. Skip this location and go to the one in Soho. There is no excuse for such lousy service!####has->nsubj->Baluchi's	has->dobj->food	food->amod->solid	food->cc->and	food->conj->decor	decor->det->a	decor->amod->nice	decor->nmod->prices	prices->case->at	prices->amod->reasonable	is->nsubj->problem	problem->det->The	problem->amod->only	is->ccomp->incompetent	incompetent->mark->that	incompetent->nsubj->manager	manager->det->the	incompetent->cop->is	incompetent->det->a	incompetent->amod->complete	offers->nsubj->He	offers->dobj->service	service->compound->subpar	offers->cc->and	offers->conj->has	has->dobj->personality	personality->neg->no	appears->nmod->fact	fact->case->In	appears->nsubj->it	appears->ccomp->going	going->nsubj->he	going->aux->is	going->xcomp->go	go->mark->to	go->dobj->postal	postal->nmod->moment	moment->case->at	moment->det->any	Skip->dobj->location	location->det->this	Skip->cc->and	Skip->conj->go	go->nmod->one	one->case->to	one->det->the	one->nmod->Soho	Soho->case->in	is->expl->There	is->nsubj->excuse	excuse->neg->no	excuse->nmod->service	service->case->for	service->amod->such	service->amod->lousy

I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there. The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated. Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive. The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also. The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent! Me and my girls will definitely go back.####went->nsubj->I	went->nmod->Areo	Areo->case->to	went->nmod->afternoon	afternoon->case->on	afternoon->det->a	afternoon->compound->Sunday	went->nmod->four	four->case->with	four->nmod->girlfriends	girlfriends->case->of	girlfriends->nmod:poss->my	went->cc->and	went->conj->spent	spent->dobj->hours	hours->nummod->three	hours->amod->enjoyable	spent->advmod->there	packed->nsubjpass->restaurant	restaurant->det->The	packed->auxpass->was	packed->nmod->first	first->case->at	packed->dep->so	packed->parataxis->waited	waited->nsubj->we	waited->nmod->bar	bar->case->at	bar->det->the	bar->nmod->minutes	minutes->case->for	minutes->nummod->20	20->advmod->about	waited->advcl->seated	seated->mark->before	seated->nsubjpass->we	seated->auxpass->were	attentive->nsubj->Most	Most->nmod->servers	servers->case->of	servers->det->the	attentive->cop->are	attentive->advmod->very	attentive->conj->friendly	attentive->cc->and	attentive->conj->attractive	attractive->advmod->quite	crowd->nsubj->atmosphere	atmosphere->det->The	crowd->cop->was	crowd->advmod->mostly	crowd->case->of	crowd->det->an	crowd->amod->older	crowd->cc->but	crowd->conj->were	were->expl->there	were->nsubj->groups	groups->det->a	groups->amod->few	groups->nmod->olds	olds->case->of	olds->amod->mid	olds->amod->20's/30	olds->compound->year	were->advmod->also	relaxed->nsubj->vibe	vibe->det->The	relaxed->cop->is	relaxed->advmod->very	relaxed->cc->and	relaxed->conj->cozy	relaxed->conj->great	great->nsubj->service	great->cop->was	relaxed->cc->and	relaxed->conj->excellent	excellent->nsubj->food	food->det->the	excellent->cop->was	go->nsubj->Me	Me->cc->and	Me->conj->girls	girls->nmod:poss->my	go->aux->will	go->advmod->definitely	go->advmod->back
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went. I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.

I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery. The food is great. Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights. I heartily recommend. There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude. Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips. Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.####eaten->nsubj->I	eaten->aux->'ve	eaten->nmod->Gruppo	Gruppo->case->at	Gruppo->compound->Pizza	eaten->dobj->times	times->det->a	times->amod->few	eaten->cc->but	eaten->advmod->often	often->advmod->more	eaten->ccomp->order	order->nsubj->I	order->dobj->delivery	great->nsubj->food	food->det->The	great->cop->is	size->nsubj->pans	pans->amod->Personal	size->cop->are	size->det->the	size->amod->perfect	size->nmod->nights	nights->case->for	nights->det->those	nights->amod->hungry	recommend->nsubj->I	recommend->advmod->heartily	is->expl->There	is->nsubj->downside	downside->det->a	is->advcl->ordering	ordering->mark->if	ordering->nsubj->you	ordering->aux->'re	ordering->compound:prt->in	is->parataxis->have	have->nsubj->guys	guys->det->the	guys->compound->delivery	have->dobj->attitude	attitude->amod->MAJOR	had->neg->Never	had->aux->have	had->nsubj->I	had->dobj->guys	guys->amod->such	guys->amod->dramatic	guys->compound->delivery	guys->acl:relcl->b/c	b/c->nsubj->lot	lot->det->a	lot->acl->huffing	huffing->mark->of	huffing->cc->and	huffing->conj->panting	huffing->cc->and	huffing->conj->muttering	muttering->nmod->breath	breath->case->under	b/c->ccomp->live	live->nsubj->I	live->nmod->walkup	walkup->case->in	walkup->det->a	walkup->acl:relcl->seem	seem->nsubj->who	seem->advmod->always	seem->xcomp->disappointed	seem->nmod->tips	tips->case->with	tips->nmod:poss->their	think->advmod->Hey	think->nsubj->I	think->ccomp->bad	bad->nsubj->2+	2+->dep->$	2+->nmod->walk	walk->case->for	walk->det->a	walk->nummod->5	walk->compound->block	bad->cop->ai	bad->neg->n't
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise. The pizza was pretty good and huge. The price very reasonable. We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally. We got most of it back at home with us. I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine. The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol####has->nsubj->Love	Love->advmod->first	first->nmod:npmod->scene	scene->det->the	first->nmod->place	place->case->off	place->det->the	has->dobj->light	light->det->a	light->compound->character	character->cc->and	character->conj->nice	light->nmod->wise	wise->case->to	wise->amod->fortunate	fortunate->advmod->itvery	wise->dep->location	good->nsubj->pizza	pizza->det->The	good->cop->was	good->advmod->pretty	good->cc->and	good->conj->huge	reasonable->dep->price	price->det->The	reasonable->advmod->very	4->nsubj->We	4->cop->were	4->cc->and	4->conj->got	got->ccomp->penne	penne->nsubj->size	size->det->the	size->compound->family	penne->dobj->vodka	vodka->det->a	vodka->compound->la	vodka->acl:relcl->bucket	bucket->nsubj->which	bucket->cop->was	bucket->advmod->tremendously	bucket->amod->gigantic	bucket->compound->portiona	bucket->nmod->food	food->case->of	bucket->advmod->literally	got->nsubj->We	got->dobj->most	most->nmod->it	it->case->of	got->advmod->back	back->case->at	back->dep->home	back->nmod->us	us->case->with	say->nsubj->I	say->aux->would	say->ccomp->fine	fine->mark->that	fine->nsubj->all	fine->cop->was	fine->cc->and	fine->conj->tasty	say->cc->but	say->conj->someting	someting->nsubj->heaviness	heaviness->det->the	heaviness->nmod->stomach	stomach->case->on	stomach->nmod:poss->my	someting->ccomp->mention	mention->mark->that	mention->nsubj->i	mention->aux->ca	mention->neg->n't	mention->neg->not	mention->cc->or	mention->conj->undermine	extra->nsubj->penne	penne->det->The	penne->compound->pasta	extra->cop->was	extra->advmod->pretty	extra->advmod->buttery	extra->dep->creamy	creamy->acl:relcl->means	means->nsubj->which	means->dobj->task	task->det->a	task->amod->big	task->acl->diggest	diggest->mark->to	diggest->xcomp->tasty	tasty->advcl->first	first->case->at	extra->cc->but	extra->conj->say	say->nsubj->i	say->aux->would	say->ccomp->full	full->mark->that	full->nsubj->i	full->cop->was	full->nmod->slice	slice->case->with	slice->det->a	slice->nmod->pizza	pizza->case->of	extra->cc->and	extra->conj->stuffedlol	stuffedlol->nsubj->7	7->acl->count	count->mark->to	count->ccomp->pennegot	pennegot->dobj->moody	moody->det->a	moody->amod->little	pennegot->advmod->afterwards	pennegot->dep->cause	stuffedlol->cop->was

I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond. I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna. Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor. I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)! I lOVE THIS PLACE! Keep up the good work guys!####read->nsubj->I	read->advmod->just	read->dobj->review	review->nmod:poss->Mocaramel	Mocaramel->case->'s	read->cc->and	read->conj->felt	felt->dep->compelled	compelled->xcomp->respond	respond->mark->to	coming->nsubj->I	coming->aux->have	coming->aux->been	coming->advmod->here	coming->nmod->years	years->case->for	coming->cc->and	coming->conj->have	have->dobj->nothing	nothing->nmod->things	things->case->but	things->amod->good	coming->xcomp->say	say->mark->to	say->nmod->service	service->case->about	service->det->the	service->cc->and	service->conj->staff	staff->det->the	staff->amod->great	say->nmod->Lanterna	Lanterna->case->at	Lanterna->compound->La	treated->nmod->years	years->case->Over	years->det->the	treated->nsubj->host	host->det->the	host->appos->Vittorio	Vittorio->cc->and	Vittorio->conj->crew	crew->nmod:poss->his	treated->aux->have	treated->advmod->always	treated->dobj->me	treated->nmod->family	family->case->as	treated->parataxis->able	able->advcl->does	does->mark->although	does->nmod->business	business->case->with	business->det:predet->all	business->det->the	does->nsubj->gem	gem->det->this	gem->amod->not-so-little	does->xcomp->amazing	amazing->nsubj->it	able->nsubj->he	able->cop->'s	able->advmod->even	able->xcomp->remember	remember->mark->to	remember->dobj->visitor	visitor->det->a	visitor->amod->consistent	consistent->cc->but	consistent->conj->not-so-frequent	amazed->nsubjpass->I	amazed->aux->'ve	amazed->advmod->also	amazed->auxpass->been	amazed->nmod->additions	additions->case->at	additions->det:predet->all	additions->det->the	additions->amod->new	additions->nmod->years	years->case->in	years->det->the	years->amod->past	years->amod->few	additions->conj->Bar	Bar->det->A	Bar->amod->new	Bar->compound->Jazz	additions->conj->Garden	Garden->det->the	Garden->amod->fantastic	fantastic->advmod->most	Garden->compound->Dining	additions->conj->Best	Best->det->the	Best->dep->Pizzas	Pizzas->compound->Thin	Pizzas->compound->Crust	additions->cc->and	additions->conj->Menu	Menu->advmod->now	Menu->det->a	Menu->compound->Lasagna	Menu->acl:relcl->is	is->nsubj->which	is->xcomp->die	die->mark->to	die->advcl->lasagnas	lasagnas->mark->for	lasagnas->nsubj->these	lasagnas->cop->are	lasagnas->neg->not	lasagnas->nmod:poss->your	lasagnas->amod->average	lOVE->nsubj->I	lOVE->dobj->PLACE	PLACE->compound->THIS	Keep->compound:prt->up	Keep->dobj->guys	guys->det->the	guys->amod->good	guys->compound->work
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night. I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here. We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu. Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck. We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?####ate->nsubj->girlfiends	girlfiends->nmod:poss->My	girlfiends->cc->and	girlfiends->conj->I	ate->nmod->OG	OG->case->at	ate->nmod:tmod->night	night->advmod->again	night->amod->last	have->nsubj->I	have->xcomp->say	say->mark->to	say->ccomp->had	had->nsubj->I	had->aux->have	had->neg->never	had->dobj->meal	meal->det->a	meal->amod->disapointing	had->advmod->here	made->nsubj->We	made->aux->could	made->aux->have	made->dobj->meal	meal->det->a	meal->nmod->dumplings	dumplings->case->of	dumplings->det->the	dumplings->amod->yummy	made->nmod->menu	menu->case->from	menu->det->the	menu->amod->dumpling	saved->advmod->Luckily	saved->nsubj->we	saved->dobj->room	saved->nmod->Salmon	Salmon->case->for	Salmon->det->the	Salmon->compound->BBQ	Salmon->conj->Bass	Bass->compound->Sea	Salmon->cc->and	Salmon->conj->Duck	Duck->compound->Crispy	got->nsubj->We	got->dobj->tipsy	tipsy->det->a	tipsy->amod->little	got->nmod->sake	sake->case->from	sake->det->the	got->cc->but	got->conj->that	that->cop->is	that->neg->n't	that->dep->about	about->dobj->what	about->nsubj->nights	nights->compound->Saturday	nights->nmod->girlfriends	girlfriends->case->with	girlfriends->det->the	about->cop->are	about->advmod->all
